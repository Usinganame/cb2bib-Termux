<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

cb2Bib is a free, open source, and multiplatform application for rapidly
extracting unformatted, or unstandardized bibliographic references from
email alerts, journal Web pages, and PDF files.

cb2Bib facilitates the capture of single references from unformatted and
non standard sources. Output references are written in BibTeX. Article
files can be easily linked and renamed by dragging them onto the cb2Bib
window. Additionally, it permits editing and browsing BibTeX files,
citing references, searching references and the full contents of the
referenced documents, inserting bibliographic metadata to documents, and
writing short notes that interrelate several references.

**Current version: cb2Bib 2.0.1**. See [Change Log
File](https://www.molspaces.com/cb2bib/doc/changelog/) for a detailed
list of changes and acknowledgments, and [Release Notes](#relnotes) for
additional notes and information.

See [Release Note cb2Bib 2.0.1](#relnotes201).

### []{#descrip} Description

cb2Bib reads the clipboard text contents and process it against a set of
predefined patterns. If this automatic detection is successful, cb2Bib
formats the clipboard data according to the structured BibTeX reference
syntax.

Otherwise, if no predefined format pattern is found or if detection
proves to be difficult, manual data extraction is greatly simplified by
cb2Bib. In most cases, such manual data extraction will provide with a
new, personalized pattern to be included within the predefined pattern
set for future automatic extractions.

Once the bibliographic reference is correctly extracted, it is added to
a specified BibTeX database file. Optionally, document files are renamed
to a DocumentID filename and moved to a desired directory as a personal
article library, and their metadata is updated with the bibliographic
reference. See [Reading and Writing Bibliographic Metadata](#metadata)
section.

cb2Bib facilitates writing short notes related to bibliographic
collections. Notes are written using a minimalist markup on a plain text
editor, and can latter be converted to HTML. Related references and
links become easily accessible on any browser or by the embedded cb2Bib
viewer. See [Release Note cb2Bib 1.1.0](#relnotes110).

### []{#usage} Using cb2Bib

#### []{#procedure} Procedure

-   **Select the reference to import from the email or web browser**\
    On Unix machines, cb2Bib automatically detects mouse selections and
    clipboard changes. On Windows machines, copy or Ctrl-C is necessary
    to activate cb2Bib automatic processing.
-   **cb2Bib automatic processing**\
    Once text is selected cb2Bib initiates the automatic reference
    extraction. It uses the predefined patterns from file `regexp.txt`
    to attempt automatic extraction. See [Configuring
    Files](#c2bconf_files) section for setting the user predefined
    pattern matching expression file. After a successful detection
    bibliographic fields appear on the cb2Bib item line edits. Manual
    editing is possible at this stage.
-   **cb2Bib manual processing**\
    If no predefined format pattern is found or if detection proves to
    be difficult, a manual data extraction must be performed. Select,
    either using mouse or Shift+arrow keys, the reference fields from
    the cb2Bib clipboard area. A popup menu will appear after selection
    is made. Choose the corresponding bibliographic field. See [BiBTeX
    Entry Types Available as cb2Bib Fields](#entrytype). If operating
    with the keyboard, first letter of the field is set as a menu
    shortcut. Then, typing 'A' sets selection to 'author', or '+A' to
    'add authors'. Selection is postprocessed and added to the cb2Bib
    item line edit. cb2Bib field tags will show on the cb2Bib clipboard
    area. Once the manual processing is done, cb2Bib clipboard area will
    contain the matching pattern. The pattern can be further edited and
    stored to the `regexp.txt` file using **Insert Regular Expression**,
    Alt+I. See the [Extracting Data from the Clipboard](#clipboard) and
    [Regular Expression Editor](#regexpeditor) sections.
-   **Download reference to cb2Bib**\
    cb2Bib has the built-in functionality to interact with publishers
    "Download reference to Citation Manager" service. Choose BibTeX
    format, or any other format that you can translate using **External
    Clipboard Preparsing Command**. See [Additional Keyboard
    Functionality](#keyboard), **Alt C**. Click "Download" from your
    browser. When asked "Open with..." select cb2Bib. cb2Bib will be
    launched if no running instance is found. If already running, it
    will place the downloaded reference to the clipboard, and it will
    start processing. Make sure your running instance is aware of
    clipboard changes. See [Buttons Functionality](#c2bbuttons). For
    convenience, the shell script `c2bimport`, and the desktop config
    file `c2bimport.desktop` are also provided.
-   **Adding documents**\
    PDF and other documents can be added to the BibTeX reference by
    dragging the file icon and dropping it into the cb2Bib's panel.
    Optionally, document files, are renamed to a DocumentID filename and
    moved to a desired directory as a personal article library (See
    [Configuring Documents](#c2bconf_documents) section). Linked to a
    reference documents correspond to the BibTeX tag `file`. Usual
    reference manager software will permit to retrieve and visualize
    these files. Download, copy and/or moving is scheduled and performed
    once the reference is accepted, e.g., once it is saved by pressing
    **Save Reference** button.
-   **Multiple retrieving from PDF files**\
    Multiple PDF or convertible to text files can be sequentially
    processed by dragging a set of files into cb2Bib's PDFImport dialog.
    By starting the processing button, files are sequentially converted
    to text and send to cb2Bib clipboard panel for reference extraction.
    See [PDF Reference Import](#pdfimport) for details.
-   **Journal-Volume-Page Queries**\
    Takes input Journal, Volume, and first page from the corresponding
    edit lines and attempts to complete the reference. Additionally,
    queries consider `title`, `DOI`, and an `excerpt`, which is a
    simplified clipboard panel contents. See [Configuring
    Network](#c2bconf_network) section, the distribution file
    `netqinf.txt`, and [Release Note cb2Bib 0.3.5](#relnotes035) for
    customization and details.
-   **BibTeX Editor**\
    cb2Bib includes a practical text editor suitable for corrections and
    additions. cb2Bib capabilities are readily available within the
    editor. E.g., the reference is first sent to cb2Bib by selecting it,
    and later retrieved from cb2Bib to the editor using 'right click' +
    'Paste Current BibTeX'. Interconversions Unicode &lt;-&gt; LaTeX,
    long &lt;-&gt; abbreviated journal name, and adding/renaming PDF
    files are easily available. BibTeX Editor is also accessible through
    a shell command line. See [cb2Bib Command Line](#commandline) and
    [Embedded File Editor](#bibeditor).

#### []{#c2bbuttons} Buttons Functionality

-   **About**\
    About cb2Bib, bookmarks, and online help.
-   **Configure**\
    Configure cb2Bib. See [Configuration](#configuration) section.
-   **Search references**\
    Opens the cb2Bib's search dialog. The search is performed either on
    the current BibTeX file, or for all BibTeX files on the current
    directory. Optionally, the search is extended to reference's files.
    Hits are displayed on an editor window. See [Search BibTeX and PDF
    Document Files](#bibsearch). See also [Configuring
    Utilities](#c2bconf_utilities) section to configure the external to
    text converter.
-   **PDFImport**\
    Launches cb2Bib's PDFImport window. Files dragged into PDFImport
    window are sequentially translated to text and sent to cb2Bib
    clipboard panel. cb2Bib automatic and manual capabilities are then
    easily available to extract and supervise reference extractions. See
    [PDF Reference Import](#pdfimport).
-   **Exit**\
    Exits cb2Bib.
-   **Dis/Connect Clipboard**\
    Toggles automatic cb2Bib and desktop clipboard connection. While the
    automatic cb2Bib-clipboard connection permits reducing keystrokes,
    the disconnected mode is needed in cases where multiple mouse
    selections or copies are required to complete a reference
    extraction. See also [Release Note cb2Bib 0.4.1](#relnotes041) and
    [Release Note cb2Bib 0.2.1](#relnotes021) if you experience problems
    with this feature.
-   **Network Reference Query**\
    Starts Network Query. It usually takes input Journal, Volume, and
    first page from the corresponding edit lines and attempts to
    complete the reference. See [Configuring Network](#c2bconf_network)
    network section to customize querying. See the distribution file
    `netqinf.txt` and also [Release Note cb2Bib 0.3.5](#relnotes035) for
    the details.
-   **View BibTeX Reference**\
    View current reference as will be output to the BibTeX file.
    Eventual manual changes should be done on the item line edit.
-   **Save Reference**\
    Inserts the current bibliographic reference to the output BibTeX
    file. This action decides whether or not a reference is accepted.
    Scheduled actions such as PDF downloading, copying or renaming will
    be performed at this time.
-   **Open BibTeX File**\
    Opens the current BibTeX output file. Right click within the BibTeX
    Editor window for its particular functionality. See also [Embedded
    File Editor](#bibeditor).

#### []{#keyboard} Additional Keyboard Functionality

Most keyboard shortcuts are customizable. See [Configuring
Shortcuts](#c2bconf_shortcuts). In the following, default shortcuts are
used to describe functionality.

-   **Alt A**\
    Starts [cb2Bib Annote](#c2bannote). Specify the note's filename in
    the dialog. A new note is created if the file name does not exist.
    The cb2Bib Annote is opened as a separate program. Exiting cb2Bib
    will not exit the note's viewer. On the viewer, pressing key E
    launches the default text editor. The viewer will track the editor,
    and will update the note's display each time the editor saves it.
    The viewer's functionality is disabled if cb2Bib was not compiled
    and linked against WebKit. See [cb2Bib Command Line](#commandline)
    to use Annote in command line mode.
-   **Alt B**\
    Edits the Bookmarks and Network Query Info file `netqinf.txt`.
-   **Alt C**\
    Preparses cb2Bib's clipboard through a user specified external
    script or tool. Preparsing is necessary to catch formatted
    references that can not be easily extracted using recognition
    patterns, or that are written in ambiguous formats. Many available
    scripts or specific user-written tools can be incorporated to cb2Bib
    through this external preparsing capability. In addition, simple,
    one-line scripts can be used within PDFImport to provide, for
    instance, the journal name when missing from the PDF first page. The
    cb2Bib distribution contains the sample scripts `isi2bib` and
    `ris2bib` that convert ISI and RIS formatted strings to BibTeX. See
    [Configuring Clipboard](#c2bconf_clipboard) for details.
-   **Alt D**\
    Deletes temporary BibTeX output file. This permits using cb2Bib
    output files as temporary media to transfer references to a
    preferred reference manager and preferred format. **Caution**: This
    feature is not intended for the users who actually store their
    references in one or several BibTeX files. Remember to import
    references prior to delete cb2Bib output file.
-   **Alt E**\
    Edits the regular expression file. It permits an easy access and
    modification of stored extraction patterns. New patterns are
    conveniently added to to the regular expression file by using the
    **RegExp Editor** button functionality.
-   **Alt F**\
    Launches a file dialog for selecting the source file name for the
    BibTeX entry `file`. Selected files are displayed either, as the
    actual source filename, or, as the target filename, depending on the
    file copy/rename/move settings. See [Configuring
    Documents](#c2bconf_documents). Alternatively to **Alt F**,
    documents can be easily linked to a reference by dragging the
    document file and dropping it to the cb2Bib panel.
-   **Alt I**\
    Edits and optionally inserts the current regular expression pattern.
    See the [Extracting Data from the Clipboard](#clipboard) and
    [Regular Expression Editor](#regexpeditor) sections.
-   **Alt J**\
    Edits the Journal Abbreviations file.
-   **Alt O**\
    Opens the currently linked document for browsing. Documents can be
    easily linked to a reference by dragging the document file and
    dropping it to the cb2Bib panel, or with **Alt F**. Linked documents
    correspond to the BibTeX tag `file`.
-   **Alt P**\
    Postprocess BibTeX output file. It launches a user specified script
    or program to postprocess the current BibTeX file. The cb2Bib
    distribution contains two sample scripts. One, `bib2pdf` is a shell
    script for running `latex` and `bibtex`; this permits to check the
    BibTeX file for possible errors, and to easily produce a suitable
    output for printing. The other one, `bib2end.bat` is a batch script
    for running `bib2xml` and `xml2end`, which converts references into
    Endnote format. See [Configuring BibTeX](#c2bconf_bibtex) for
    details.
-   **Alt R**\
    Restarts cb2Bib automatic engine. Takes input data not from the
    system clipboard but from the cb2Bib clipboard panel. This permits
    editting the input stream from poorly translated PDF captions,
    correcting for author superscripts, or helps in debugging regular
    expressions.
-   **Alt W**\
    Writes current reference to the source document file. This option is
    intended for writing and updating bibliographic metadata to document
    files without needing to use BibTeX files. Only local and writable
    files are considered.
-   **Alt X**\
    Check Repeated looks for existing references in the BibTeX directory
    similar to the current one. The search is done for exact cite ID,
    and for title and author field values, or, if empty, for booktitle
    and editor,using the [approximate
    string](https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0751) search pattern. See also
    [Configuring BibTeX](#c2bconf_bibtex).
-   **F4**\
    Toggles between Main and Other Fields reference edit tabs.
-   **Esc**\
    Quits cb2Bib popup menu. The cb2Bib menu pops up each time a
    selection in made in the clipboard panel. This saves keystrokes in a
    normal bibliographic extraction. Press **Esc** or **Right Click**
    mouse button if you need to gain access to the editor cut/copy/paste
    functionality instead.

### []{#requirements} Requirements

#### []{#requirements_comp} Compilation

To compile cb2Bib, the following libraries must be present and
accessible:

-   Qt 5.7.0 or later from [Qt Project](https://www.qt.io/download). On
    a Linux platform with Qt preinstalled, make sure that the `devel`
    packages and Qt tools are also present.
-   QtWebKit or QtWebEngine library (optional) to compile cb2Bib Annote
    viewer. No special action/flag is needed during compilation.
-   Compression libraries [LZ4](https://lz4.github.io/lz4/) or
    [LZO](https://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/) (optional). To
    chose a particular one, type `configure âenable-lz4` or
    `configure âenable-lzo`. On machines with SSE4 instruction set, the
    [LZSSE](https://github.com/ConorStokes/LZSSE/) compressor can be
    used in place of LZ4 and LZO, by typing `configure âenable-lzsse`.
    If none of the above compressors were appropiate on a particular
    platform, type `configure âenable-qt-zlib` before compiling.
-   X11 header files if compiling on Unix platforms. Concretely, headers
    `X11/Xlib.h` and `X11/Xatom.h` are needed.
-   The header files `fcntl.h` and `unistd.h` from `glibc-devel` package
    are also required. Otherwise compilation will fail with
    `` `::close' undeclared ``.

#### []{#requirements_run} Deployment

Although not needed for running cb2Bib, the following tools extend
cb2Bib applicability:

-   `MathJax`, available at
    [https://www.mathjax.org](https://www.mathjax.org/), for displaying
    mathematical notation. Simply, download and unzip it in a desired
    directory. See [Configuring Annote](#c2bconf_annote).
-   `ExifTool`, version 7.31 or later, available at
    [https://exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/), for metadata
    insertion.
-   `pdftotext`, found packaged as `xpdf`, and downloadable from
    <https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html>.
-   The `bib2xml` and `xml2end`
    [BibUtils](http://bibutils.refbase.org/), for the postprocessing
    script `bib2end.bat` on Windows platforms.
-   LaTeX packages, for checking BibTeX files correctness and for
    references printing through the shell script `bib2pdf`.

<div class="textblock">

### []{#linux-tar} Installing on Unix systems (tarball)

The following is the general, platform independent install procedure.

-   Unpack the distribution file:\
    \
    `tar -xzvf cb2bib-2.0.1.tar.gz`\
    \
-   Move to cb2Bib directory:\
    \
    `cd cb2bib-2.0.1`\
    \
-   Type the following commands:\
    \
    `./configure --prefix /usr/local`\
    `make`\
    `make install`\
    \

Installation is now complete.

**Note:** If the `./configure` step would fail while having the
appropriate Qt libraries and utilities installed, try ` qmake` instead
of `./configure`, and configure manually the required file directories
once cb2Bib first starts.

To uninstall type `make uninstall` from within the cb2Bib compilation
directory.

### []{#linux-rpm} Installing on Unix systems (RPM)

To build an appropriate RPM for your platform, type, e. g.,

`rpm ârebuild âtarget=i686 cb2bib-2.0.1-1.src.rpm`

or a distro-dependend, equivalent command (perhaps `rpmbuild`). This
will compile cb2Bib and build the required binary RPM (often placed at
the `/usr/src/packages/RPMS/i686` directory). See also [Release Note
cb2Bib 0.6.90](#relnotes0690) regarding `QTDIR` environment if having
compilation problems. Once the binary RPM is build, installation is as
follows.

To install your RPM binary, simply type

`rpm -Uhv cb2bib-2.0.1-1.i686.rpm`

To uninstall, type

`rpm -e cb2bib-2.0.1`

### []{#linux-deb} Installing on Debian systems (deb)

To install cb2Bib, first make sure that you are actually using the
packages for the proper Debian suite, as configured in the
`/etc/apt/sources.list` file.

Next, issue the following commands as root,

`apt-get update`

`apt-get install cb2bib`

to resolve all required dependencies and install the program.

### []{#windows} Installing on Windows systems

On Windows platforms installation is simple. Just launch the Windows
Installer

`cb2bib-2.0.1-install.exe`

and follow the installation wizard indications. To uninstall, click the
'Unistall' icon.

### []{#mac} Installing on Mac OS X

To install cb2Bib from its sources, make sure you have the following
build tools on your system:

    \
    <https://www.qt.io/download/>\
    \
-   XCode from Apple:\
    \
    <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>\
    \
-   bin-utils via darwinports\
    \
    \
-   **Buiding with make/Makefile:**\
    \
    Type on a shell window:\
    \
    `tar -xzvf cb2bib-2.0.1.tar.gz`\
    `cd cb2bib-2.0.1`\
    `./configure --prefix /Applications/cb2Bib --qmakepath /Developer/Tools/Qt/qmake`\
    `make`\
    `make install`\
    \
-   **Buiding with make/Makefile (no configure and no external
    compression):**\
    \
    Type on a shell window if `configure` fails:\
    \
    `tar -xzvf cb2bib-2.0.1.tar.gz`\
    `cd cb2bib-2.0.1`\
    `/Developer/Tools/Qt/qmake -config use_qt_zlib`\
    `make`\
    \
-   **Buiding with XCode:**\
    \
    Type on a shell window:\
    \
    `tar -xzvf cb2bib-2.0.1.tar.gz`\
    `cd cb2bib-2.0.1`\
    `/Developer/Tools/Qt/qmake cb2bib.pro -spec macx-xcode`\
    \
    Open `cb2bib.xcodeproj` with XCode and build from there.\
    \

**Note:** It has been reported that qmake does not make usable XCode
projects from subdir qmake projects. It is possible to produce
one-single `.pro` file for the whole project, by typing
`qmake -project -r` to create a base `.pro` file. An example and
detailed instructions can be found at `./qmake/cb2bib-osx.pro`.

### []{#c2bconf_annote} Configuring Annote

-   **Annote Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)**\
    This file contains the style sheet to personalize the appearance of
    the HTML notes generated by the cb2Bib. The cb2Bib distribution
    includes the `tex2html.css` file as a CSS template.
-   **MathJax Header File**\
    The mathematical notation in the text notes is displayed by
    [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), the successor of the
    [jsMath](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/) Java Script
    library. Its location and configuration must be specified inside the
    HTML files in order to be known by the browser. Check and eventually
    edit the distribution file `tex2html_local_mathjax_header.html`.
    Should web script be preferred set script source to
    `https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js`.
-   **Include CSS in HTML**\
    Styles for the notes will be included, if checked, into the HTML
    file. In this way, all the information, text and layout, is
    contained in one single file.
-   **Use relative links**\
    If checked, linked local files will be set relative to the current
    HTML document.
-   **Annote Viewer Fonts**\
    Selects default and monospaced fonts for the Annote viewer. Changes
    in the fonts might need restarting the viewer unless using some of
    the latest QtWebKit libraries. The viewer is disabled if cb2Bib was
    not compiled and linked against WebKit. Note also that fonts
    specified in the CSS prevail over this selection.

### []{#c2bconf_bibtex} Configuring BibTeX

-   **Cite ID Pattern**\
    Specifies the pattern for formatting cite's ID. Predefined
    placeholders are available as a context menu, by right-clicking this
    edit line. Placeholders will be substituted by the actual reference
    field values. See [Cite and Document ID
    Placeholders](#idplaceholders) for descriptions.
-   **Author and Editor Name Format**\
    Sets Authors and Editor names in abbreviated or full form, if the
    latter is available.
-   **Journal Name Format**\
    Sets output journal names in abbreviated or full form. Note that
    this feature only works if journal names are found in the
    `Journal Abbreviation List file`. See [Processing of Journal
    Names](#journalproc).
-   **Number Separator**\
    Sets number separator, e.g., ' - ' or ' â '. Spaces count. It
    applies to `pages`, multiple `volume`, `number`, and `year` cases.
-   **Cite Command Pattern**\
    Specifies the pattern for formatting cite command. Predefined
    command patterns for LaTeX and Markdown (see [Pandoc User's
    Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations)) are available in
    the line context menu. Other, customized command patterns are also
    available, see [Cite Command Placeholders](#citeplaceholders) for
    descriptions.
-   **Convert entry strings to LaTeX**\
    If checked, cb2Bib converts special characters to LaTeX commands.
    Most BibTeX import filters do not process LaTeX escaped characters.
    Therefore, keeping this box unchecked can be appropriate when using
    cb2Bib as a temporary media to transfer references to non BibTeX
    reference managers.
-   **Set 'title' in double braces**\
    If checked, it writes extra braces in title. This will keep
    capitalization as is, when processed by BibTeX.
-   **Postprocess 'month'**\
    If checked, cb2Bib elaborates the 'month' string on a BibTeX
    fashion. E.g., 'April 1' becomes '"1\~" \# apr'. No processing is
    done if the input string is not written in English.
-   **Try Heuristic Guess if recognition fails**\
    If checked, when automatic recognition fails, cb2Bib tries to catch
    some of the fields of the reference through an heuristic set of
    rules. See [Field Recognition Rules](#heuristics).
-   **Check Repeated On Save**\
    If checked, cb2Bib looks for existing references in the BibTeX
    directory similar to the one being saved. The search is based on
    exact cite ID match, or on reference contents, by considering title
    and author field values, or, if empty, booktitle and editor, and
    using the [approximate string](https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0751)
    search pattern. If similar references are found, the current
    reference is not saved, and the similar ones are displayed. Pressing
    the **save button one second time will proceed to actually saving
    the current reference**. Note that this feature is not applied in
    command line mode, when using `cb2bib âtxt2bib` or
    `cb2bib âdoc2bib`. See also [Additional Keyboard
    Functionality](#keyboard).
-   **External BibTeX Postprocessing**\
    Use this box to select a BibTeX postprocessing external tool. The
    name of the executable, the command arguments and the output file
    extension are required fields. Arguments, any number, are passed to
    the executable. For the sake of generality, it is required to
    specify the `%finput` and `%foutput` placeholders. The first one is
    later substituted by the current BibTeX filename. The second one is
    substituted by the current filename with the specified output
    extension. **Caution:** Be careful if using the same file extension
    for input and output, e.g., using `bib` because you want to use a
    beautifier or a sorting script. cb2Bib has no control on external
    disk modifications. Therefore, if the script failed, the input data
    would possibly be lost. See also [Additional Keyboard
    Functionality](#keyboard).

### []{#c2bconf_clipboard} Configuring Clipboard

-   **Replace/Remove from Input Stream**\
    If checked, input stream is preprocessed by performing a
    customizable set of string substitutions/removals. This option is
    mainly intended to remove image HTML `alt` tags. Although not
    visible, `alt` tags reach the clipboard when selecting and copying
    text. Author lists with email icons may contain `alt` strings that
    would interfere with the author names processing. In addition, this
    option is also appropriate to help translating special characters to
    Unicode and LaTeX. Use it carefully, as to avoid unwanted or
    unsuspected substitutions. See also [Extracting Data from the
    Clipboard](#clipboard).
-   **External Clipboard Preparsing Command**\
    Preparses input stream through an external, user-defined tool. Use
    the box bellow to specify its name and path. cb2Bib executes the
    command `tool_name tmp_inputfile tmp_outputfile`. You might consider
    a wrapper shell script to fullfill this particular syntax
    requirement. Two examples, `isi2bib` and `ris2bib` are provided. To
    test them, make sure the [BibUtils
    Package](http://bibutils.refbase.org/) is available on your machine.
    Otherwise, modify these scripts according to your needs. See also
    [Additional Keyboard Functionality](#keyboard), [Extracting Data
    from the Clipboard](#clipboard), and the examples [ISI Reference
    Format](#ex_isi_format) and [RIS Reference Format](#ex_ris).
-   **Perform always, as part of an automatic extraction**\
    Performs preparsing each time the recognition engine is invoked.
    **Caution:** cb2Bib, when not in disconnected mode, starts the
    recognition engine each time the clipboard changes. Therefore, it
    might send arbitrary data to the external parsing tool. The tool
    might not be prepared to handle **'any data'** and might fall into a
    sort of **'infinite loop'**. cb2Bib kills the external tool after a
    reasonable waiting. But, if the tool is called through a wrapper
    script, killing the script will not end the tool itself. Therefore,
    **check this box only when needed**. If you write your own
    preparser, design it as to write no data to output file whenever it
    can not process an input properly. When the preparser produces no
    data, cb2Bib sends instead the input stream to the recognition
    engine. In this way, preparsing and normal cb2Bib functioning will
    work harmoniously.
-   **Do not show log**\
    If unchecked, the external process messages, and the input and
    output streams are shown in a log window. Showing output logs is
    useful for debugging purposes.
-   **Add document metadata to Input Stream**\
    When checked, if the document linked to a reference contains
    relevant metadata, then metadata will be added to the current
    clipboard contents. The metadata is included at the time of adding
    the document to the current reference, e. g., when dropping a file
    into the cb2Bib panel. If the document has BibTeX information,
    cb2Bib will automatically set the corresponding fields. If it has
    not, but relevant bibliographic information is found, this data is
    only added to the clipboard panel. To insert it in the edit lines,
    activate the Heuristic Guess (Alt+G). The option **Prepend** or
    **Append** to the clipboard contents is provided for conveniently
    writing regular expressions considering metadata contents. File
    documents are linked to the references by the BibTeX tag 'file'. See
    also [Reading and Writing Bibliographic Metadata](#metadata).

### []{#c2bconf_documents} Configuring Documents

-   **Rename and Copy/Move document files to Directory**\
    If selected, each file 'drag and dropped' onto the cb2Bib main
    window is renamed to `DocumentID.pdf` (or DocumentID.ps,
    DocumentID.dvi, etc.) and moved to the storage directory. If
    unselected, the file URL is written to the `file` BibTeX keyword,
    without any renaming or moving of the file. The actual copy/move
    action is scheduled and performed once the reference is accepted,
    e.g., once it is saved.
-   **Copy or Move document files**\
    Choose whether copy or move Network Files dropped onto the cb2Bib
    main window. See also **Use External Network Client**.
-   **Set directory relative to the BibTeX File Directory**\
    If checked, the document file is copied/moved to the current BibTeX
    file directory. If the Documents Directory box contains a **relative
    directory** it will be added to the file name. For example, if it
    contains `articles`, files will be copied to
    `/current_bibtex_path/articles/`. An absolute path in the Documents
    Directory box will be ignored in this context. Note that the file
    dialog returns here relative file addresses. Consequently, only the
    necessary portion of the full name, instead of the fullpath
    filename, is written to the BibTeX entry. File retrieving from
    within the cb2Bib browser will be relative to the BibTeX file
    absolute location.\
    Use this option if you plan to store in a same or a related
    directory the BibTeX and document files. This option is appropriate
    for storing bibliographic collections in removal devices. Likewise,
    when cb2Bib is launched in USB mode, by means of the command line
    switch `âconf`, the alternate option is not available. See [Release
    Note cb2Bib 0.8.4](#relnotes084) and [Export Selected
    Entries](#export_entries).
-   **Insert BibTeX metadata to document files**\
    If checked, cb2Bib will write bibliographic metadata to the linked
    document, once the current reference is accepted and saved. See also
    [Reading and Writing Bibliographic Metadata](#metadata).
-   **Document ID Pattern**\
    Specifies the pattern for formatting the document's filenames.
    Predefined placeholders are available as a context menu, by
    right-clicking this edit line. Placeholders will be substituted by
    the actual reference field values. See [Cite and Document ID
    Placeholders](#idplaceholders) for descriptions.
-   **ExifTool Metadata writer**\
    cb2Bib uses [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) for writing
    bibliographic metadata to the attached documents. Select here the
    ExifTool path name. On Windows, remember renaming `exiftool(-k).exe`
    to `exiftool.exe` for command line use. See also [Writing
    Metadata](#metadata_write).

### []{#c2bconf_files} Configuring Files

-   **Journal Abbreviation List File**\
    This file contains a list of journal names equivalences: a
    capital-letter acronym, standard abbreviated form, and full name of
    the journal. If an input journal name is recognized, cb2Bib will use
    the standard abbreviated form for the `journal` bibkey. If your
    usual journal were not within the distributed, default
    `abbreviations.txt`, you could edit this file, or point to a
    personalized abbreviation file. **Note:** Changes in the
    abbreviation file only take place after reestarting cb2Bib. See
    [Processing of Journal Names](#journalproc).
-   **Regular Expression List File**\
    The cb2Bib distribution includes the file `regexps.txt` with a few
    set of rules for reference extraction. This includes most of the
    scientific literature. Extracting from email alerts or publisher
    abstract pages is a *volatile* task. Information does not follow a
    standardized structure. Extraction pattern may then change as often
    as the web design needs to. Besides, such extraction from the
    clipboard is system dependent, in a way that produces different
    formatting of the text copies on different systems. You can use your
    personalized `regexps.txt` file, for testing, debugging -regular
    expressions are reloaded each time the automatic recognition engine
    executes-, and fullfiling your particular extraction needs.
-   **Bookmarks and Network Query Info File**\
    The cb2Bib distribution includes the file `netqinf.txt` that
    contains bookmarks data, and server related information for
    bibliographic querying. Note that cb2Bib treats bibliographic
    queries as generalized net bookmarks. This allows accessing almost
    any online bibliographic resource. Check this file for
    implementations details and customization.
-   **Browser Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)**\
    This file contains the style sheet to configure the appearance of
    the bibliographic references when viewed in browser mode. The cb2Bib
    distribution includes the `references.css` and `references-dark.css`
    file as a CSS examples.
-   **Part Of Speech (POS) Lexicon**\
    This box must contain the address to the cb2Bib distribution file
    `lexicon.pos`. This file contains a set of patterns and related POS
    information required for indexing documents, i. e., to extract
    keywords from documents for the c2bCiter module.
-   **Search In Files Cache Directory**\
    Directory containing internal data for Search In Files
    functionality. If an existing directory is selected cb2Bib will
    write all internal data on it. If otherwise, cache data will be
    written on the same directory from where BibTeX are searched. It
    might be, therefore, convenient to group all this files in a
    separate directory that does not need to be backup, and that can
    easily be deleted whenever desired.

### []{#c2bconf_fonts} Configuring Fonts

-   **Font Selector**\
    Selects the main window and editor font family and size.
-   **Context Colors**\
    Doubleclick on context color items to select syntax highlighter font
    color. Besides syntax highlighting, and to ease manual bibliographic
    extractions, cb2Bib has the following coloring convention. 'cb2Bib
    unrelevant text' colors non-word, non-digit, and cb2Bib's internal
    tags. 'cb2Bib relevant text' refers to the reference's year. 'cb2Bib
    highly relevant' attempts to guess text sectioning, highlighting
    'abstract', 'introduction', and 'keywords'.

### []{#c2bconf_network} Configuring Network

-   **Use External Network Client**\
    cb2Bib manages local and network files in an equivalent manner.
    Network file retrieving, however, requires sometimes password and/or
    cookies administration. The KDE desktop incorporates `kfmclient`
    utility. A command `kfmclient (copy|move|exec) source [destination]`
    permits copying or moving files, with `kfmclient` taking care of
    advanced browsing preferences. By checking this box, cb2Bib will use
    the specified file manger client.
-   **Use Proxy**\
    If checked, cb2Bib will access the network through a proxy host. Set
    the Host name, the Port, and the proxy Type. A login dialog will
    appear if the proxy requires authentication. Login data is not
    stored, it must be entered at each session.
-   **Perform Network Queries after automatic reference extractions**\
    Network queries can be used to complete a partial reference
    extraction. For instance, provided a reference 'J. Name, 25, 103'
    and an appropriate pattern to extract it, cb2Bib will attempt to
    complete the reference automatically. No query is performed if
    automatic reference extraction was tagged as BibTeX.
-   **Download document if available**\
    If checked, cb2Bib downloads document files to the directory
    specified in **Rename and Copy/Move document files to Directory**.
    See also the file `netqinf.txt` for details. Download is scheduled
    and performed once the reference is accepted, e.g., once it is
    saved. Note that when document file is local, e.g., when PDFImport
    or switch `âdoc2bib` is used, no document is downloaded.
-   **Keep Query temporary files (Debug Only)**\
    cb2Bib may use up to three temporary files to perform a network
    query. If this box is checked, the temporary files are not deleted.
    This facilitates the testing and customization of the information
    file `netqinf.txt`.

### []{#c2bconf_shortcuts} Configuring Shortcuts

-   Customizes most key sequences for actions shortcuts. Concretely,
    cb2Bib specific actions are configurable, but not standard actions
    such as 'Open', 'Exit', 'Copy', or 'Paste', which are already
    predefined to the standard, specific key sequences for each
    platform. Shortcuts are customizable for the cb2Bib main panel,
    editor, and reference list actions. Single-key shortcuts, i.e., for
    manual reference extraction and shortcuts in c2bCiter, are
    non-configurable, since they they closely map non-translatable
    BibTeX keywords.

### []{#c2bconf_utilities} Configuring Utilities

-   **To plain text converter**\
    Selects the external `some_format_to_text` tool that cb2Bib uses to
    convert document files prior to reference extraction and searching.
    cb2Bib executes the line command
    `converter [options] inputfile tmp_output.txt`, where `[options]`
    are user defined arguments. As a default, cb2Bib launches `pdf2cb`,
    a modified PDF to text utility found in the XPDF package.
    Modifications are available at xpdf/ directory in the cb2Bib
    sources. Default arguments are `-q -f 1 -l 1` to extract only the
    first, title page when used within PDFImport, and `-q`, to convert
    the complete document when used within Search in Files. Appropriate
    for PDFImport could also be a document metadata extractor. Often
    metadata contains structured information regarding document authors,
    title, and source. A simple shell script wrapper could be the
    following `any2text_search`:

``` {.fragment}
   #!/bin/csh
   # Convert documents to text according to filename extension
   # any2text_search input_fn.ext output_fn.txt
   set ext = $1:e
   if ( $ext == 'djvu' ) then
      /usr/bin/djvutxt "$1" "$2"
      if ($status) exit 1
   else if ( $ext == 'chm' ) then
      (/usr/local/bin/archmage -c text "$1" "$2") >& /dev/null
      if ($status) exit 1
   else
   # If using pdf2cb
      /path/to/pdf2cb -q "$1" "$2"
   # If using pdftotex
   #  /usr/bin/pdftotext -enc UTF-8 "$1" "$2"
      if ($status) exit 1
   endif
```

[]{#bibsearch}Search BibTeX and PDF Document Files
--------------------------------------------------

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

### []{#descrip} Description {#description}

-   **Search pattern**\
    Patterns and composite patterns can be either [approximate
    strings](https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0751), strings, contexts,
    regular expressions, or wildcard filters. Patterns admit Unicode
    characters. The scope of each pattern can be the reference as a
    whole or be focused on a particular reference field. The fields
    `year`, `file`, and `journal` are treated specifically. The field
    `year` has the qualifiers `Exact`, `Newer`, and `Older`. The field
    `file` can optionally refer to either the filename or the contents
    of such a file. Finally, for `journal`, the input pattern is
    duplicated to the, if available, journal fullname, and they two are
    checked against the `journal` actual field contents and, if
    available, its expanded contents. For example, typing 'ijqc'
    retrieves all references with `journal` being 'Int. J. Quantum
    Chem.'. Or, typing 'chemistry' retrieves any of 'J. Math. Chem.',
    'J. Phys. Chem.', etc. This expansion is not performed when the
    pattern scope is set to `all`.
-   **Search scope**\
    By default, searches are performed on the current BibTeX output
    file. If **Scan all BibTeX files** is checked the search will extend
    to all BibTeX files, extension .bib, present in the current
    directory. It might be therefore convenient to group all reference
    files in one common directory, or have them linked to that
    directory. When **Scan linked documents** is checked, and one or
    more pattern scope is `all` or `file`, the contents of the file in
    `file` is converted to text and scanned for that given pattern. See
    [Configuring Utilities](#c2bconf_utilities) section to configure the
    external to text converter.
-   **Search modifier**\
    cb2Bib converts TeX encoded characters to Unicode when parsing the
    references. This permits, for instance, for the pattern 'MÃ¸ller' to
    retrieve either 'MÃ¸ller' or 'M{\\o}ller', without regard to how the
    BibTeX reference is written. By checking **Simplify source**, the
    reference and the converted PDF files are simplified to plain ASCII.
    In this way, the pattern '\\bMoller\\b' will hit any of 'MÃ¸ller',
    'M{\\o}ller', or 'Moller'. Additionally, all non-word characters are
    removed, preserving only the ASCII, word structure of the source.
    Note that source simplification is only performed for the patterns
    whose scope is `all` or `file` contents, and that and so far, cb2Bib
    has only a subset of such conversions. Implemented TeX to Unicode
    conversions can be easily checked by entering a reference. The
    Unicode to ASCII letter-only conversion, on the other hand, is the
    one that cb2Bib also uses to write the reference IDs and, hence, the
    renaming of dropped files. cb2Bib can understand minor sub and
    superscript formatting. For instance, the pattern 'H2O' will
    retrieve 'H~2~O' from a BibTeX string `H$_{2}$O`.

### []{#contextsearch} Contextual Search

A convenient way to retrieve documents is by matching a set of keywords
appearing in a close proximity context, while disregarding the order in
which the words might had been written. cb2Bib considers two types of
contextual searches. One flexibilizes phrase matching only at the level
of the constituting words. It is accessed by selecting
`Fixed string: Context` in the pattern type box. The other one, in
addition, stems the supplied keywords. It is accessed by selecting
`Context`. By way of stemming, the keyword *analyze*, for example, will
also match *analyse*, and *aluminum* will match *aluminium* too.

The syntax for `Context` type patterns is summarized in the following
table:

``` {.fragment}
Operator   Example                          Expansion

space      contextual search                contextual AND search

|          contextual search|matching       contextual AND (search|match)

+          contextual search|+matching      contextual AND (search|\bmatching\b)

_          contextual_search                contextual.{0,25}search

-          non-parametric                   non.{0,1}parametr


Diacritics and Greek letters:

           naÃ¯ve search                     (naÃ¯ve|naive) AND search

           kendall tau                      kendall AND (tau|Ï)
```

In the above examples, operator space `AND` means match words in any
order. Operator `_` preserves word order, and operator `+` prevents
stemming and forces exact word match. Operator `-` considers cases of
words that might had been written either united, hyphenated, or space
separated. Diacritics are expanded if the diacritic mark is specified.
This is, *naive* will not match *naÃ¯ve*. On the other hand, Greek
letters are expanded only when typed by name.

### []{#notes} Notes

-   cb2Bib uses an internal cache to speed up the search of linked
    files. By default data is stored as `current_file.bib.c2b`. It might
    be more convenient, however, to setup a temporary directory out of
    the user data backup directories. See **Search In Files Cache
    Directory** in [Configuring Files](#c2bconf_files). When a linked
    file is processed for the first time, cb2Bib does several string
    manipulations, such as removing end of line hyphenations. This
    process is time consuming for very large files.
-   The **approximate string** search is described in reference
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0751>. It reduces the chance of missing
    a hit due to transcription and decoding errors in the document
    files. Approximate string is also a form of serendipitous
    information retrieval.

        --sloppy                                           Accept guesses in automatic reference extraction

 Examples:
        cb2bib                                             Start cb2Bib extraction panel
        cb2bib --import tmp_reference_filename             Import reference
        cb2bib --bibedit filename.bib                      Edit BibTeX filename.bib
        cb2bib --conf                                      Start cb2Bib in USB mode
        cb2bib --doc2bib *.pdf references.bib              Extract references from PDF title pages

 Notes:
  -Use switch --conf to particularize specific settings for specific actions.
  -The file cb2bib.conf must be readable and writable. If it does not exist, cb2Bib will create one
   based on predefined defaults.
  -If starting cb2Bib from a removable media, use the command 'cb2bib --conf' without configuration
   filename. Settings will be read from and written to /cb2bib/full/path/cb2bib.conf, being therefore
   independent of the mounting address that the host computer will provide.
  -To import references from a browser select when asked c2bimport, which expands to 'cb2bib --import %f'.
   The browser will provide the temporary reference filename.
  -A number of factors influence the reliability of automatic extractions. Consider writing customized
   regular expressions and network queries, and use metadata when available.

 Important:
  -The commands --doc2bib and --txt2bib do not append the references to the references.bib. They create
   a new file, or silently overwrite it if already exists.
```

-   **Note:** On Windows use `c2bconsole` instead of `cb2bib`. See
    [Release Note cb2Bib 1.3.0](#relnotes130).
-   **Note:** If using reference extraction command, see [Automatic
    Extraction: Questions and Answers](#faq_automatic_extraction).

[]{#c2bannote}cb2Bib Annote
---------------------------

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

The cb2Bib Annote module is named after the BibTeX key `annote`. Annote
is not for a 'one reference annotation' though. Instead, Annote is for
short notes that interrelate several references. Annote takes a plain
text note, with minimal or no markup, inserts the bibliographic
citations, and converts it to a HTML page with links to the referenced
documents.

From within cb2Bib, to write a note, type `Alt+A`, enter a filename,
either new or existing, and once in Annote, type `E` to start the
editor. Each time you save the document the viewer will be updated. For
help on Annote's syntax type `F1`. If cb2Bib was compiled without
Annote's Viewer, typing `Alt+A` will start the editor and HTML viewing
will be committed to the default web browser.

From the command line, typing

``` {.fragment}
cb2bib --html-annote annote.tex
```

will produce the HTML file `annote.tex.html`.

[]{#c2bciter}cb2Bib Citer
-------------------------

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

The cb2Bib Citer is a keyboard based module for inserting citation IDs
into a working document. Conveniently, the command `c2bciter`, or its
expansion `cb2bib âciter`, can be assigned to a global, desktop wide
shortcut key. This will provide an easy access to the citer from within
any text editor. Pressing the shortcut turns on and off the citer panel.
Once appropriate references are selected, pressing key C sets the
citations either to the clipboard or to a LyX pipe, closes the citer
panel, and returns keyboard focus to the editor.

By default, `c2bciter` loads all references from the current directory,
specified in the cb2Bib main panel. On the desktop tray, the cb2Bib icon
indicates that the citer is running. Its context menu offers the
possibility to load other files or directories, or to toggle full screen
mode.

Search, filtering, navigation, and citation are keyword based. Pressing
keys A, I, J, T, and Y sorts the references by author, included date,
journal, title, and year, respectively. Key F initiates filtering, and
Esc leaves filtering mode. References are selected when pressing enter.
Key S toggles the current selection display, and Del clears the
selection. The combination Shift + letter navigates through the rows
starting by the letter.

Advanced filtering capabilities are available after indexing the
documents. Document indexing, or term or key sentence extraction, is
performed by clicking the tray icon menu action Index Documents. Once
indexing is done and after clicking Refresh, pressing K displays the
document extracted keywords, and pressing G, the collection glossary of
terms. On a keyword, pressing R display all documents indexed by the
keyword. On a document, pressing R display related documents.
Relatedness is set from keyword based similarity measures.

Key sequence Alt+C toggles clipboard connection on and off. When
connection is on, the clipboard contents is set, each time it changes,
as the filter string. This provides a fast way to retrieve a given
reference while browsing elsewhere.

[]{#toc-additional-features}Additional Features
-----------------------------------------------

### []{#bibeditor}Embedded File Editor

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

cb2Bib contains a practical editor suitable to manipulate the files
related to a cb2Bib session. Abbreviations, bookmarks, regular
expressions, and BibTeX are readily available. On BibTeX mode, the
editor contains a Reference List to ease file navigation, and to extend
the editor functionality. The BibTeX editor can optionally be turned to
a reference browser.

#### []{#bookmarks} Bookmarks

Bookmarks pointing to local or network files are available at the editor
menu bar. They provide a fast access to external resources. Concretely,
they are suitable for retrieving working documents, writing notes, or
for accessing internet databases.

The editor bookmark functionality had been introduced in the cb2Bib
version 0.9.3. Currently, bookmarks are set manually in the
`netqinf.txt` file, see [Configuring Files](#c2bconf_files). Each
bookmark is an entry line with the form

``` {.fragment}
editorbookmark=Description|Target file name|Shortcut|Icon file name
```

having four fields, description, target file name, shortcut, and icon
file name, separated with three (required) vertical bars |.

``` {.fragment}
# Bookmark Examples:
# - A URL:
editorbookmark=URL Description|https://www.molspaces.com/cb2bib/doc/bibeditor/||
# - A separator, which is a blank line:
editorbookmark=
# - A TeX document, which will be opened with its default application:
editorbookmark=Document Description|/home/doc/chapter1.tex||
```

#### []{#update_metadata} Update Documents Metadata

The Update Documents Metadata functionality is available at the Edit and
context menus on the BibTeX editor mode. Documents referred in the
BibTeX file tags are scanned for metadata. If the BibTeX reference does
not coincide with the bibliographic metadata, the document metadata is
updated. In this way, metadata is synchronized with the BibTeX file
contents. A log window appears, and possible errors are reported.
Reported errors are, non-existence of a document file, read-only files,
mismatches between BibTeX references and the actual metadata (often due
to HTML tags or other illegal characters in BibTeX), or that the writing
to the document format is not implemented. Note that this process will
update all documents referenced in the BibTeX file. **While this process
is safe, it implies writing into the documents.** Therefore take the
usual measures and backup your data. See also [Writing
Metadata](#metadata_write).

#### []{#export_entries} Export Selected Entries

Selected entries can be exported to a separate BibTeX document. Click on
`File->Export Entries` menu option, and provide an export filename at
the Export Dialog. Optionally, export will copy the document files
attached to the citation. The copy of documents is similar to the cb2Bib
'rename/copy/move' general procedure. See [Configuring
Documents](#c2bconf_documents), on **Set directory relative to the
BibTeX File Directory**, for copying options. Documents will not be
overwritten: copying of existing documents is skipped. Possible issues
are reported in the new document, as LaTeX comments.

### []{#predefinedplaceholders}Predefined Placeholders

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

#### []{#idplaceholders} Cite and Document ID Placeholders

-   `<<author_all_abbreviated>>` Takes first three letters of the last
    word of all authors's last name in cite, and converts to lowercase.
-   `<<author_all_initials>>` Takes capitalized initials of all authors
    in cite.
-   `<<author_first>>` Takes first author last name.
-   `<<author_first_lowercase>>` Takes first author last name in
    lowercase.
-   `<<citeid>>` This placeholder is meant to be used **alone, and only
    for document IDs**. It takes the pattern defined for the cite ID. If
    the cite ID is modified manually, the document ID is synchronized
    automatically.
-   `<<journal_initials>>` Takes capitalized initials of journal name.
-   `<<pages_first>>` First page.
-   `<<ppages_first>>` First page, written as, e. g., 'p125'.
-   `<<title>>` Title. To truncate titles exceeding a maximum length `l`
    use `<<title_l>>`, where `l` stands for an integer value.
-   `<<title_underscored>>` Title with blanks set to underscores. To
    truncate title to `l` characters use `<<title_underscored_l>>`.
-   `<<title_first_word>>` First word in title, in lowercase.
-   `<<volume>>` Volume number.
-   `<<year_abbreviated>>` Last two digits from year.
-   `<<year_full>>` All digits from year.

**Note:** If `author` is empty, `editor` will be considered instead. On
conference proceedings or monographs this situation is usual. Similarly,
if `title` is empty, `booktitle` is considered.

**Note:** Only one placeholder of a given field, e. g.
`<<author_first>>` or `<<author_all_initials>>`, should be used to
compose the ID patterns. cb2Bib only performs one substitution per field
placeholder.

**Note:** cb2Bib performs a series of string manipulations, such as
stripping diacritics and ligatures, aimed to provide ID values suitable
for BibTeX keys and platform independent filenames. Currently only ASCII
characters are considered.

#### []{#citeplaceholders} Cite Command Placeholders

-   `<<citeid>>` The `citeid` placeholder replicates the pattern for
    each citation in the selected citation list. For example, the
    pattern `\citenum{<<citeid>>}` expands to
    `\citenum{cid1} \citenum{cid2} ... `
-   `<<prefix|citeids|separator>>` The `citeids` placeholder replaces
    the selected citation list by prepending `prefix` and appending
    `separator` within the pattern. For example, the markdown pattern
    `[<<@|citeids|;>>]` expands to `[@cid1; @cid2; ...]`, and the LaTeX
    pattern `\citeauthor{<<|citeids|,>>}` expands to
    `\citeauthor{cid1, cid2, ...}`.

**Note:** For additional information on cite commands see [LaTeX
Bibliography
Management](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management)
and [Pandoc User's Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations).

### []{#entrytype}BiBTeX Entry Types Available as cb2Bib Fields

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

cb2Bib includes nearly all standard and extended BibTeX fields. The
complete list is as follows. The field descriptions are taken from [The
BibTeX
Format](http://www.fb10.uni-bremen.de/anglistik/langpro/bibliographies/jacobsen-bibtex.html)
written by Dana Jacobsen.

#### []{#main-fields}Main Fields

`abstract` An abstract of the work.

`author` The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the
LaTeX book.

`file` Usually, the PDF filename of the work.

`journal` A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals.

`keywords` Key words used for searching or possibly for annotation.

`pages` One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as `42--111`
or `7,41,73--97` or `43+` (the \``+`' in this last example indicates
pages following that don't form a simple range). To make it easier to
maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a
single dash (as in `7-33`) to the double dash used in TeX to denote
number ranges (as in `7--33`).

`title` The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book.

`volume` The volume of a journal or multi-volume book.

`number` The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a
work in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a
technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are
given numbers in a named series.

`year` The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year it
was written. Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as
`1984`, although the standard styles can handle any `year` whose last
four nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as
`\hbox{(about 1984)}`.
#### []{#other-fields}Other Fields

`address` Usually the address of the `publisher` or other type of
institution. For major publishing houses, van Leunen recommends omitting
the information entirely. For small publishers, on the other hand, you
can help the reader by giving the complete address.

`annote` An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography
styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated
bibliography.

`booktitle` Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the LaTeX
book for how to type titles. For book entries, use the `title` field
instead.

`chapter` A chapter (or section or whatever) number.

`doi` The Digital Object Identifier is a unique string created to
identify a piece of intellectual property in an online environment.

`edition` The edition of a book---for example, \`\`Second''. This should
be an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown
here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.

`editor` Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book. If
there is also an `author` field, then the `editor` field gives the
editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears.

`eprint` Electronic document file.

`institution` The sponsoring institution of a technical report.

`ISBN` The International Standard Book Number.

`ISSN` The International Standard Serial Number. Used to identify a
journal.

`month` The month in which the work was published or, for an unpublished
work, in which it was written. You should use the standard three-letter
abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the LaTeX book.

`note` Any additional information that can help the reader. The first
word should be capitalized.

`organization` The organization that sponsors a conference or that
publishes a `manual`.

`publisher` The publisher's name.

`school` The name of the school where a thesis was written.

`series` The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire
book, the the `title` field gives its title and an optional `series`
field gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book
is published.

`URL` The WWW Universal Resource Locator that points to the item being
referenced. This often is used for technical reports to point to the ftp
site where the postscript source of the report is located.

### []{#metadata}Reading and Writing Bibliographic Metadata

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

#### []{#metadata_read} Reading Metadata

Metadata in scientific documents had been rarely appreciated and used
for decades. For bibliographic metadata, no format specification had
been widely accepted. cb2Bib adapted back in 2008 the PDF predefined
metadata capabilities to set BibTeX bibliographic keys in document
files.

cb2Bib reads all XMP (a specific XML standard devised for metadata
storage) packets found in the document. It then parses the XML strings
looking for nodes and attributes with key names meaningful to
bibliographic references. If a given bibliographic field is found in
multiple packets, cb2Bib will take the last one, which most often, and
according to the PDF specs, is the most updated one. The fields `file`,
which would be the document itself, and `pages`, which is usually the
actual number of pages, are skipped.

The metadata is then summarized in cb2Bib clipboard panel as, for
instance

``` {.fragment}
[Bibliographic Metadata
<title>arXiv:0705.0751v1  [cs.IR]  5 May 2007</title>
/Bibliographic Metadata]
```

This data, whenever the user considers it to be correct, can be easily
imported by the build-in 'Heuristic Guess' capability. On the other
hand, if keys are found with the prefix `bibtex`, cb2Bib will assume the
document does contain bibliographic metadata, and it will only consider
the keys having this prefix. Assuming therefore that metadata is
bibliographic, cb2Bib will automatically import the reference. This way,
if using PDFImport, BibTeX-aware documents will be processed as
successfully recognized, without requiring any user supplied regular
expression.

See also [Release Note cb2Bib 1.0.0](#relnotes100), [Configuring
Clipboard](#c2bconf_clipboard), and [PDF Reference Import](#pdfimport).

#### []{#metadata_write} Writing Metadata

Once an extracted reference is saved and there is a document attached to
it, cb2Bib will optionally insert the bibliographic metadata into the
document itself. cb2Bib writes an XMP packet as, for instance

``` {.fragment}
<bibtex:author>P. Constans</bibtex:author>
<bibtex:journal>arXiv 0705.0751</bibtex:journal>
<bibtex:title>Approximate textual retrieval</bibtex:title>
<bibtex:type>article</bibtex:type>
<bibtex:year>2007</bibtex:year>
```

The BibTeX fields `file` and `id` are skip from writing. The former for
the reason mentioned above, and the latter because it is easily
generated by specialized BibTeX software according to each user
preferences. LaTeX escaped characters for non ASCII letters are
converted to UTF-8, as XMP already specifies this codec.

The actual writing of the packet into the document is performed by
ExifTool, an excellent Perl program written by Phil Harvey. See
[https://exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/). ExifTool supports several
document formats for writing. The most relevant here are Postscript and
PDF. For PDF documents, metadata is written as an incremental update of
the document. This exactly preserves the binary structure of the
document, and changes can be easily reversed or modified if so desired.
Whenever ExifTool is unable to insert metadata, e.g., because the
document format is not supported or it has structural errors, cb2Bib
will issue an information message, and the document will remain
untouched.

Documents Metadata](#update_metadata).

### []{#pdfimport}PDF Reference Import

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

#### []{#intro_automatic_extraction} Introduction

Articles in PDF or other formats that can be converted to plain text can
be processed and indexed by cb2Bib. Files can be selected using the
Select Files button, or dragging them from the desktop or the file
manager to the PDFImport dialog panel. Files are converted to plain text
by using any external translation tool or script. This tool, and
optionally its parameters, are set in the cb2Bib configure dialog. See
the [Configuring Utilities](#c2bconf_utilities) section for details.

Once the file is converted, the text, and optionally, the preparsed
metadata, is sent to cb2Bib for reference recognition. This is the
usual, two step process. First, text is optionally preprocessed, using a
simple set of rules and/or any external script.or tool. See [Configuring
Clipboard](#c2bconf_clipboard). Second, text is processed for reference
extraction. cb2Bib so far uses two methods. One considers the text as a
full pattern, which is checked against the user's set of regular
expressions. The better designed are these rules, the best and most
reliable will be the extraction. The second method, used when no regular
expression matches the text, considers instead a set of predefined
subpatterns. See [Field Recognition Rules](#heuristics).

At this point users can interact and supervise their references, right
before saving them. Allowing user intervention is and has been a design
goal in cb2Bib. Therefore, at this point, cb2Bib helps users to check
their references. Poorly translated characters, accented letters,
'forgotten' words, or some minor formatting in the titles might be worth
considering. See [Glyph & Cog's Text
Extraction](https://www.glyphandcog.com/textext.html) for a description
on the intricacies of PDF to text conversions. In addition, if too few
fields were extracted, one might perform a network query. Say, only the
DOI was catch, then there are chances that such a query will fill the
remaining fields.

The references are saved from the cb2Bib main panel. Once Save is
pressed, and depending on the configuration, see [Configuring
Documents](#c2bconf_documents), the document file will be either
renamed, copied, moved or simply linked onto the `file` field of the
reference. If **Insert BibTeX metadata to document files** is checked,
the current reference will also be inserted into the document itself.

When several files are going to be indexed, the sequence can be as
follows:

-   **Process next after saving**\
    Once files are load and Process is pressed, the PDFImport dialog can
    be minimized (but not closed) for convenience. All required
    operations to completely fill the desired fields (e.g. dynamic
    bookmarks, open DOI, etc, which might be required if the data in
    document is not complete) are at this point accessible from the main
    panel. The link in the `file` field **will be permanent**, without
    regard to which operations (e.g. clipboard copying) are needed,
    until the reference is saved. The source file can be open at any
    time by right clicking the `file` line edit. Once the reference is
    saved, the next file will be automatically processed. To skip a
    given document file from saving its reference, press the Process
    button.
-   **Unsupervised processing**\
    In this operation mode, all files will be sequentially processed,
    following the chosen steps and rules. **If the processes is
    successful**, the reference is automatically saved, and the next
    file is processed. **If it is not**, the file is skipped and no
    reference is saved. While processing, the clipboard is disabled for
    safety. Once finished, this box is unchecked, to avoid a possible
    accidental saving of a void reference. Network queries that require
    intervention, i.e., whose result is launching a given page, are
    skipped. The processes follows until all files are processed.
    However, it will stop to avoid a file being overwritten, as a result
    of a repeated key. In this case, it will resume after manual
    renaming and saving. See also [cb2Bib Command Line](#commandline),
    commands `âtxt2bib` and `âdoc2bib`.

#### []{#faq_automatic_extraction} Automatic Extraction: Questions and Answers

-   **When does cb2Bib do automatic extractions?**\
    cb2Bib is conceived as a lightweight tool to extract references and
    manage bibliographies in a simple, fast, and accurate way. Accuracy
    is better achieved in semi-automatic extractions. Such extractions
    are handy, and allow user intervention and verification. However, in
    cases where one has accumulated a large number of unindexed
    documents, automatic processing can be convenient. cb2Bib does
    automatic extraction when, in PDFImport mode, 'Unsupervised
    processing' is checked, or, in command line mode, when typing
    `cb2bib âdoc2bib *.pdf tmp_references.bib`, or, on Windows,
    `c2bconsole.exe` instead of `cb2bib`.
-   **Are PDFImport and command line modes equivalent?**\
    Yes. There are, however, two minor differences. First, PDFImport
    adds each reference to the current BibTeX file, as this behavior is
    the normal one in cb2Bib. On the other hand, command line mode will,
    instead, overwrite `tmp_references.bib` if it exists, as this is the
    expected behavior for almost all command line tools. Second, as for
    now, command line mode does not follow the configuration option
    'Check Repeated On Save'.
-   **How do I do automatic extraction?**\
    To test and learn about automatic extractions, the cb2Bib
    distribution includes a set of four PDF files that mimic a paper
    title page. For these files, distribution also includes a regular
    expression, in file `regexps.txt`, capable of extracting the
    reference fields, provided the `pdftotex` flags are set to their
    default values. Processing these files, should, therefore, be
    automatic, and four messages stating
    `Processed as 'PDF Import Example'` should be seen in the logs. Note
    that extractions are configurable. A reading of
    [Configuration](#configuration) will provide additional, useful
    information.
-   **Why some entries are not saved and files not renamed?**\
    Once you move from the fabricated examples to real cases, you will
    realize that some of the files, while being processed, are not
    renamed and their corresponding BibTeX data is not written. For each
    document file, cb2Bib converts its first page to text, and from this
    text it attempts to extract the bibliographic reference. By design,
    when extraction fails, cb2Bib does nothing: no file is moved, no
    BibTeX is written. This way, you know that the remaining files in
    the origin directory need special, manual attention. **Extractions
    are seen as failed, unless reliable data is found in the text**.
-   **What is *reliable data*?**\
    Note that computer processing of natural texts, as extracting the
    bibliographic data from a title page, is nowadays an approximated
    procedure. cb2Bib tries several strategies: **1)** allow for
    including user regular expressions very specific to the extraction
    at hand, **2)** use metadata if available, **3)** guess what is
    reasonable, and, based on this, make customized queries. Then,
    cb2Bib considers extracted **data is reliable if i)** data comes
    from a match to an user supplied regular expression **ii)** document
    contains BibTeX metadata, or **iii)** a guess is transformed through
    a query to formatted bibliographic data. As formatted bibliographic
    data, cb2Bib understands BibTeX, PubMed XML, arXiv XML, and CR JSON
    data. In addition, it allows external processing if needed. Other
    data, metadata, guesses, and guesses on query results are considered
    unreliable data.
-   **Is metadata reliable data?**\
    No. Only author, title, and keywords in standard PDF metadata can be
    mapped to their corresponding bibliographic fields. Furthermore,
    publishers most often misuse these three keys, placing, for
    instance, DOI in title, or setting author to, perhaps, the document
    typesetter. Only BibTeX XMP metadata is considered reliable. If you
    consider that a set of PDF files does contain reliable data, you may
    force to accept it using the command line switch `âsloppy` together
    with `âdoc2bib`.
-   **How successful is automatic extraction?**\
    As it follows from the given definition of reliable data, running
    automatic extractions without adhoc `regexps.txt` and `netqinf.txt`
    files will certainly give a zero success ratio. In practice,
    scenario 3) often applies: cb2Bib guesses several fields, and, based
    on the out-of-the-box `netqinf.txt` file, it obtains from the web
    either BibTeX, PubMed XML, arXiv XML, or CR JSON data.
-   **What can I do to increase success ratio?**\
    First, set your favorite journals in file `abbreviations.txt`.
    Besides increasing the chances of journal name recognition, it will
    provide consistency across your BibTeX database. In general, do not
    write regular expressions to extract directly from the PDF text.
    Conversion is often poor. Special characters often break lines, thus
    breaking your regular expressions too. Write customized queries
    instead. For instance, if your PDFs have DOI in title page, set the
    simple query

    ``` {.fragment}
    journal=The Journal of Everything|
    query=https://dx.doi.org/<<doi>>
    capture_from_query=
    referenceurl_prefix=
    referenceurl_sufix=
    pdfurl_prefix=
    pdfurl_sufix=
    action=htm2txt_query
    ```

    then, if it is feasible to extract the reference from the document's
    web page using a regular expression, include it in file
    `regexps.txt`. Note that querying in cb2Bib had been designed having
    in mind minority fields of research, for which, established
    databases might not be available. If cb2Bib failed to make
    reasonable guesses, then, you might consider writing very simple
    regular expressions to extract directly from the PDF text. For
    instance, obtain title only. Then, the posterior query step can
    provide the remaining information. Note also, especially for old
    documents, journal name is often missing from the paper title page.
    If in need of processing a series of those papers, consider using a
    simple script, that, in the cb2Bib preprocessing step, adds this
    missing information.

-   **Does successful extraction mean accurate extraction?**\
    No. An extraction is successful if reliable data, as defined above,
    is found in the text, in the metadata, or in the text returned by a
    query. Reference accuracy relies on whether or not user regular
    expressions are robust, BibTeX metadata is correct, a guess is
    appropriate, a set of queries can correct a partially incorrect
    guess, and the text returned by a query is accurate. In general,
    well designed sets of regular expressions are accurate. Publisher's
    abstract pages and PubMed are accurate. But, some publishers are
    still using images for non-ASCII characters, and PubMed algorithms
    may drop author middle names if a given author has 'too many names'.
    Expect convenience over accuracy on other sources.
-   **Can I use cb2Bib to extract comma separated value CSV
    references?**\
    Yes. To automatically import multiple CSV references you will need
    one regular expression. If you can control CSV export, choose | as
    separator, since comma might be used, for instance, in titles. The
    regular expression for

    ``` {.fragment}
    AuthName1, AuthName2 | Title | 2010
    ```

    will simply be

    ``` {.fragment}
    author title year
    ^([^|]*)\|([^|]*)\|([^|]*)$
    ```

    The reference file `references.csv` can then be split to single-line
    files typing

    ``` {.fragment}
    split -l 1 references.csv slineref
    ```

    and the command

    ``` {.fragment}
    cb2bib --txt2bib slineref* references.bib
    rm -f slineref*
    ```

    will convert `references.csv` to BibTeX file `references.bib`

### []{#clipboard}Extracting Data from the Clipboard

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

Clipboard contents is processed according to the following rules:

-   Perform external, user-defined preparsing on input stream. See
    [Configuring Clipboard](#c2bconf_clipboard).
-   Perform user-defined substitutions on input stream. See [Configuring
    Clipboard](#c2bconf_clipboard).
-   Check if input stream is already a BibTeX entry. If so, process
    entry.
-   Check if input stream is, in this order of preference, a PubMed XML,
    arXiv XML, CR JSON, or Medline entry. If so, process entry.
-   Preprocess author names: PI JOAN III -&gt; Pi III, J. (care of name
    prefixes, suffixes, and removal of ambiguities).

If otherwise,

-   Extract DOI\
    (DOI, URL and FILE/PDF are preprocessed, performed before the
    automatic recognition takes place.)
-   Extract URL
-   Remove leading and trailing white spaces, TABs and CRs.
-   "\\r\\n", "\\n" and/or "\\r" replaced by the line indicator tag
    `<NewLineN>`.
-   Replace "\\t" and ten or more consecutive "\\s" by the tabular tag
    `<TabN>`.
-   Simplify white spaces
-   Start the automatic recognition engine.

If the automatic recognition engine fails, optionally, a heuristic
guessing will be performed.

See also [Field Recognition Rules](#heuristics) and [Reading and Writing
Bibliographic Metadata](#metadata).

</div>

</div>

### []{#authorproc}Processing of Author Names

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

cb2Bib automatically processes the author names string. It uses a set of
heuristic rules. First, the authors separator is identified. And second,
it is decided whether or not author names are in natural or reverse
order, or in the 'Abcd, E., F. Ghij, ...' mixed order.

Cleanup author string:

-   Escape BibTeX to Unicode
-   Remove digits from authors string
-   Remove any character except `-',;&\.\s\w`
-   Simplify white spaces
-   Consider composing prefixes
    `(da|de|dal|del|der|di|do|du|dos|el|la|le|lo|van|vande|von|zur)`
-   Consider composing suffixes `(II|III|IV|Jr)`
-   Some publishers use superscripts to refer to multiple author
    affiliations. Text clipboard copying loses superscript formatting.
    Author strings are clean from 'orphan' lowcase, single letters in a
    preprocessing step. Everything following the pattern **\[a-z\]** is
    removed. Fortunately, abbreviated initials are most normally input
    as uppercase letters, thus permitting a correct superscript clean
    up.\
    *Caution:* Lowcase, single, a to z letters are removed from author's
    string.\
    *Caution:* Supperscripts **will be added to author Last Name** if no
    separation is provided. Users should care about it and correct these
    cases.

Rules to identify separators:

-   Contains comma and semicolon -&gt; ';'
-   Contains pattern `'^Abcd, E.-F.,'` -&gt; ','
-   Contains pattern `'^Abcd,'` -&gt; 'and'
-   Contains comma -&gt; ','
-   Contains semicolon -&gt; ';'
-   Any other -&gt; 'and'

Rules to identify ordering:

-   Contains comma and semicolon -&gt; Reverse
-   Pattern `'^Abcd,'` -&gt; Reverse
-   Pattern `'^Abcd EF Ghi'` -&gt; Natural
-   Pattern `'^Abcd EF'` -&gt; Reverse
-   Pattern `'^Abcd E.F.'` -&gt; Reverse
-   Any other pattern -&gt; Natural

</div>

</div>

### []{#journalproc}Processing of Journal Names

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

cb2Bib processes journal names according to its editable database,
stored at `abbreviations.txt`. This file contains a list of journal
names equivalences: a capital-letter acronym, the abbreviated form, and
the title of the journal, all three on one single line.

The `abbreviations.txt` file has the following structure:

``` {.fragment}
JA|J. Abbrev.|Journal of Abbreviations
AN|Am. Nat.=Amer. Naturalist|American Naturalist=The American Naturalist
```

The first field, the capital-letter acronym, is a user-defined shorthand
to access a journal title by typing it at the extraction panel.

The second field is the abbreviated form of the journal. To adapt to
multiple abbreviations in use, cb2Bib allows one alternate version of
the abbreviation, indicated with an equal sign `=`. In the above
example, the ISO 4 abbreviation 'Am. Nat.' is the primary one and 'Amer.
Naturalist' is the alternate one.

Finally, the third field is the full title of the journal. As for the
abbreviations, the full title also admits one alternate form.

Abbreviated and full title alternates serve two purposes: journal
recognition and citation styling. The former is performed internally by
cb2Bib as part of a bibliographic reference extraction, and the latter
is accomplished in the embedded BibTeX editor by replacing back and
forth abbreviated-full forms, in order to set journals in accordance to
the guidelines of a particular publication.

Journal names processing is performed whenever a string is recognized as
'journal', and, additionally, when pressing `Intro Key` at the journal
edit line.

-   Retrieves Journal name in **abbreviated form** if found.
-   If Journal name is not found in the database, returns input Journal
    name.
-   Search is case insensitive.
-   **Warning:** Journal codes can be duplicated. If duplicated, returns
    input Journal name.

-   Retrieves Journal name in **full form** if found.
-   If Journal name is not found in the database, returns input Journal
    name.
-   Search is case insensitive.
-   **Warning:** Journal codes can be duplicated. If duplicated, returns
    input Journal name.

### []{#regexpeditor}Regular Expression Editor

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

Once a manual processing is done, cb2Bib clipboard area contains the
extraction tags, plus, possibly, some other cb2Bib tags introduced
during the preprocessing (see [Extracting Data from the
Clipboard](#clipboard)). The **RegExp Editor** will generate a guess
regular expression or matching pattern usable for automated extractions.

The cb2Bib matching patterns consist of four lines: a brief description,
the reference type, an ordered list of captured fields, and the regular
expression itself.

    # cb2Bib 2.0.1 Pattern:
    American Chemical Society Publications
    article
    journal volume pages year title author abstract
    ^(.+), (\d+) \(.+\), ([\d|\-|\s]+),(\d\d\d\d)\..+<NewLine3>(.+)<NewLine4>
    (.+)<NewLine5>.+Abstract:<NewLine\d+>(.+)$

The Regular Expression Editor provides the basic skeleton and a set of
predefined suggestions. The regular expressions follow a Perl-like
sintax. There are, however, some slight differences and minor
limitations. Information about the basics on the editing and working
with Regular Expressions as used by cb2Bib can be found at the Qt
document file [Qt Documentation's QRegExp
Class](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.6/QRegExp.html#introduction).

**Remember when creating and editing regular expressions:**

-   Switch the clipboard mode to 'Tagged Clipboard Data', using the
    clipboard panel context menu.
-   Extract the bibliographic reference manually. On the clipboard panel
    will appear some cb2Bib tags that indicate which fields are being
    extracted. Once done, type Alt+I to enter to the regular expression
    editor. In the editor, there are the four line edits that define a
    cb2Bib pattern, one copy of the clipboard panel, and an information
    panel. The information panel displays possible issues, and, once
    everything is correct, the actual extracted fields. The clipboard
    panel highlights the captures for the current regular expression and
    current input text.
-   Patterns can be modified at any time by typing Alt+E to edit the
    regular expression file. Patterns are reloaded each time the
    automatic pattern recognition is started. This permits editing and
    testing.
-   cb2Bib processes sequentially the list of regular expressions as
    found in the regular expression file. It stops and picks the first
    match for the current input. **Therefore, the order of the regular
    expressions is important**. Consequently, to avoid possible clashing
    among similar patterns, consider sorting them from the most
    restrictive pattern to the less one. As a rule of thumb, the more
    captions it has the most restrictive a pattern is.
-   **The cb2Bib proposed patterns are general, and not necessarily the
    most appropriate for a particular capture**. E.g. tag `pages`
    becomes `([\d|\-|\s]+)`, which considers digits, hyphens, and
    spaces. It must be modified accordingly for reference sources with,
    e.g., `pages` written as Roman ordinals.
-   **Avoid whenever possible general patterns `(.+)`**. There is a risk
    that such a caption could include text intended for a posterior
    caption. This is why, sometimes, the cb2Bib proposed pattern is not
    hit by the input stream that originated it. **Use, whenever
    possible, cb2Bib anchors like `<NewLine1>` instead of
    `<NewLine\d+>`. They prevent `(.+)` captions to overextend**.
-   To debug a large regular expression it might be useful to break it
    to the first capturing parenthesis. For instance, the above pattern
    will be

``` {.fragment}
# cb2Bib 2.0.1 Pattern:
American Chemical Society Publications
article
journal
^(.+),
```

-   Then, check if anything is captured and if this corresponds to
    `journal`.
-   Add on successive steps your set of captions and BibTeX fields.

### []{#relnotes}Release Notes

<div class="contents">

<div class="textblock">

#### []{#relnotes201} Release Note cb2Bib 2.0.1

To optimize search on PDF's contents, cb2Bib keeps a cache with the
extracted text streams, that are compressed to reduce disk space and
reading overhead. Nowadays, compressors with extremely high
decompression speed are available. Two of them are LZSSE, for SSE4
capable architectures, and LZ4, for a broader range of CPUs. These two
compressors can now be used by cb2Bib, with the latter set as the
default compression library in cb2Bib builds. When upgrading to version
2.0.1, the **first search** on the document collection will recreate the
cache, and this step **will be noticeably slow**.

Additionally, cb2Bib 2.0.1 includes original, optimized text matching
code for AVX2 capable architectures that is used for search matching and
BibTeX parsing. This code is **not set** in default builds and needs to
be explicitly enabled at compilation time.

Finally, it is important mentioning the inclusion in version 2.0.1 of
stemmed context search, see [Contextual Search](#contextsearch) for
details, and contributed feedback in handling citations and extending
cite commands to markdown syntax, see [Predefined
Placeholders](#predefinedplaceholders).

#### []{#relnotes200} Release Note cb2Bib 2.0.0

Throughout the 1.9.x series, the cb2Bib sources were updated to the
improved string processing capabilities of Qt5 and PCRE libraries. This
update has brought a remarkable speedup for in-document searches and
full search indexing.

Alternate normalization of journal titles and abbreviations, upgrading
jsMath to MathJax, extending network queries syntax, and a PDF user
manual are the additional enhancements in cb2Bib 2.0.0.

Back in version 0.3.3, cb2Bib introduced network queries to obtain the
data for a citation. While convenient, queries to publishers' websites
were difficult to setup and fragile. Nowadays, fortunately, arXiv,
PubMed and Crossref offer structured APIs. These interfaces provide to
the end user an easy setup for completing bibliographic citations.

#### []{#relnotes190} Release Note cb2Bib 1.9.0

The cb2Bib sources have been ported to Qt5. To highlight this major
update in library requirements the version number is set to 1.9.0.
Later, once stabilized and new functionality related to Qt5 enhancements
are applied, version number will be set to 2.

At this point cb2Bib has exactly the same functionality as its preceding
version 1.5.0. To build the program, however, only qmake and its related
config procedure are available. The cmake scripts have not yet been
ported.

Qt5 brings important enhancements related to regular expressions and
string processing. Some careful updates to the cb2Bib sources are needed
to fully benefit from them. They will implemented through the 1.9.x
series. We expect by then a performance boost on full text, regular
expression based searches.

#### []{#relnotes150} Release Note cb2Bib 1.5.0

Included in version 1.5.0 sources there is a patch for XPDF 3.0.4, the
default tool to convert PDF documents to plain text. The modified code
separates superscripts to avoid words being joined to reference numbers
and author names joined to affiliations' glyphs. Interested users will
need to download the package, apply the patch, and compile it.

Additionally, this version improves converted text postprocessing. This
step normalizes character codes, reverts ligatures, restores when
possible orphan diacritics and broken words, and undoes text
hyphenation.

Conversion to text and postprocessing is important for reference
extraction, and document indexing and searching. It is therefore
recommended to delete cached document-to-text data to benefit from the
present improvements. cb2Bib stores cached texts in \*c2b files in an
user specified directory. After that, by performing a search or
initiating indexing an updated cache will be created.

#### []{#relnotes147} Release Note cb2Bib 1.4.7

Approximate and context searches effectively locate our references of
interest. As collections grow in size, and low performance devices,
netbooks and tablets, start being used, complete document searches
become demanding. Besides, it is often not clear what to query for, and
then a glossary of terms provides guidance. Often too, interest lies on
subsetting documents by being similar to a given one.

Version 1.4.7 adds a pragmatic term or keyword extraction from the
document contents. Accepted keywords are set as the substrings appearing
at least twice in one document, appearing at least in three documents,
and conforming to predefined part-of-speech (POS) sequences. Keyword
extraction is performed by either clicking on `Index Documents` at the
`c2bciter` desktop tray menu, or, by typing `cb2bib âindex [bibdirname]`
on a shell. During extraction, the `Part Of Speech (POS) Lexicon`
distribution file must be available and readable. On termination,
indexing files are saved on the `Search In Files Cache Directory`.
Simply copying this directory will synchronize keyword indexing to a
second computer.

After refreshing `c2bciter` module, pressing key G displays the glossary
of terms. On a reference, pressing K displays its list of keywords.
Pressing R on a keyword lists the references related to that keyword.
Pressing R on a reference lists similarly related references. Similarity
is assessed based on keyword occurrences. Left and Right keys provide
previous and next navigation. Pressing V on either a reference keyword,
or a keyword reference, visualizes the keyword excerpts from the
reference's document. To close excerpt dialog press Esc or Left keys.

and [cb2Bib Command Line](#commandline).

#### []{#relnotes140} Release Note cb2Bib 1.4.0

The `c2bciter` module was introduced in version 1.3.0. Its name, as it
was described, states its purpose of being "aimed to ease inserting
citation IDs into documents". In fact, it does have such functionality.
And, it has also another, equally important one: it provides a very fast
way to retrieve a given work from our personal collections.

Retrieving is accomplished through pre-sorted views of the references
and filtering. Both, views and filtering, scale on the (tens of)
thousands references. Usually, we recall a work from its publication
year, a few words from its title, or (some of the letters of) one of its
authors names. Often, what we remember is when a reference was included
into our collection. Therefore, having such a chronological view was
desirable.

The implementation of this sorted-by-inclusion-date view was not done
during the 1.3.x series, but postponed to version 1.4.0; somehow, to
indicate that some sort of 'proprietary' BibTeX tag might be required to
specify inclusion timestamps. I have been reluctant through the cb2Bib's
life span to introduce 'cb2Bib-only' tags in the BibTeX outputs. I
believe that there is little gain, and it costs, possibly, breaking
interoperability.

In the end, the choice was to not write any 'timestamp' tag in
references. Instead, `c2bciter` checks for the last modified date of the
linked documents to build an approximated chronological view. The
advantage is that all, not just 'version 1.4.0 or later', references are
sorted. Furthermore, if a reference is later corrected, and the document
metadata is updated too, the modification date is reflected in the view.
The obvious inconvenience is that no such sorting can be done for
references without an attached document.

See also [cb2Bib Citer](#c2bciter).

#### []{#relnotes130} Release Note cb2Bib 1.3.0

When version 0.2.7 came up, it was mentioned in [Release Note cb2Bib
0.2.7](#relnotes027) that cb2Bib 'doesn't have the means to
automatically discern an author name from a department or street name'.
I forgot mentioning, that I did not expect cb2Bib would have had such a
feature. Since the last [Release Note cb2Bib 1.1.0](#relnotes110), the
cb2Bib internals had changed significantly. Some changes, such heuristic
recognition for interlaced authors and affiliations, get easily noticed.
Other changes, however, do not, and need additional explanation.

From version 1.2.3, the switches `âtxt2bib` and `âdoc2bib` set cb2Bib to
work on console mode. The non-exact nature of the involved extractions
makes logging necessary. On Windows, graphic or console modes must be
decided not at run time, but when the application is built. So far,
logging and globing were missing. This release adds the convenience
wrapper `c2bconsole`. Typing `c2bconsole âtxt2bib i*.txt out.bib`, for
instance, will work as it does in the other platforms.

Lists of references are now sorted case and diacritic insensitive. For
some languages such a choice is not the expected one, and some operating
systems offer local-aware collation. Due to usual inconsistencies and
inaccuracies in references, this decision was taken to group together
'Density Matrix' with 'Density-matrix', and MÃ¸ller with Moller, which,
in a personal collection, most probably, refer to the same concept and
to the same person. Additionally, document to text converted strings are
now clean from extraneous, non-textual symbols. Therefore, recreating
cache files is recommended.

Finally, this release introduces a new module, named `c2bciter`, and
aimed to ease inserting citation IDs into documents. The module should
ideally stay idle at the system tray, and be recalled as needed by
pressing a global, desktop shortcut. This functionality, while
desirable, and usual in dictionaries, is platform and desktop dependent.
On KDE there are currently known issues when switching among virtual
desktops.

See also [cb2Bib Citer](#c2bciter), and [cb2Bib Command
Line](#commandline).

#### []{#relnotes110} Release Note cb2Bib 1.1.0

A frequent request from cb2Bib users has been to expand the command line
functionality. So far few progress has been seen in this regard. First,
the addition of in-document searches and reading/inserting metadata were
priorities. Second, cb2Bib is not the tool to interconvert among
bibliographic formats. And third, cb2Bib is designed to involve the user
in the search process, in the archiving and validation of the discovered
works and references.

For the latter reason, and for not knowing a priori how would such a
tool be designed, the cb2Bib internals had been interlaced to its
graphical interface. At the time of version 0.7.0, when the graphical
libraries changed, and a major refactoring was required, the code
started moving toward a better modularization and structure. The current
release pushes code organization further. As a result, it adds two new
command line switches: `âhtml-annote` and `âview-annote`.

The new cb2Bib module is named after the BibTeX key 'annote'. Annote is
not for a 'one reference annotation' though. Instead, Annote is for
short notes that interrelate several references. Annote takes a plain
text note, with minimal or no markup, inserts the bibliographic
citations, and converts it to a HTML page with links to the referenced
documents.

From within cb2Bib, to write your notes, type Alt+A, enter a filename,
either new or existing, and once in Annote, type E to launch your
default text editor. For help, type F1. Each time you save the document
the viewer will be updated. To display mathematical notations, install
[jsMath](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/) locally. And,
remember, code refactoring introduces bugs.

See also [cb2Bib Annote](#c2bannote) and [cb2Bib Command
Line](#commandline).

#### []{#relnotes100} Release Note cb2Bib 1.0.0

Approximately four years ago the first cb2Bib was released. It included
the possibility of easily linking a document to its bibliographic
reference, in a handy way, by dragging the file to the main (at that
time, single) panel. Now, in version 1.0.0, when a file is dropped,
cb2Bib scans the document for metadata packets, and checks, in a rather
experimental way, whether or not they contain relevant bibliographic
information.

Publishers metadata might or might not be accurate. Some, for instance,
assign the DOI to the key Title. cb2Bib extracts possibly relevant
key-value pairs and adds them to clipboard panel. Whenever key-value
pairs are found accurate, just pressing Alt+G imports them to the line
edits. If keys with the prefix `bibtex` are found, their values are
automatically imported.

The preparsed metadata that is added to the clipboard panel begins with
`[Bibliographic Metadata` and ends with `/Bibliographic Metadata]`.
Therefore, if you are using PDFImport together with a set of regular
expressions, such that they contain the begin (\^) or end (\$) anchors,
you can safely replace them by the above tags. In this manner, existing
regular expressions remain useful with this minor change. And, with the
advantage that, if recognition fails for a given document, metadata
might give the hardest fields to extract from a PDF article, which are
author and title.

See also [Reading and Writing Bibliographic Metadata](#metadata).

#### []{#relnotes084} Release Note cb2Bib 0.8.4

The previous cb2Bib release added the command line option
`âconf [full_path]cb2bib.conf` to specify the settings location. This
feature was intended, mainly, as a clean way to run the program on a
host computer from a removable drive. The work done focused on arranging
the command line and settings related code. It was left for a later
release to solve some requirements regarding the managing of file
pathnames and temporary files.

This release addresses these two points. Now, when cb2Bib is launched as
`cb2bib âconf` âwithout a configuration filenameâ it treats filenames as
being relative to the cb2Bib actual location. Temporary files, if
needed, will be placed at this location as well. Therefore, no data is
being written on the host, and cb2Bib works independently of the actual
address that the host assigns to the removable drive.

The Windows' un/installer cleans/sets configuration data on the
registry. Being aware of this particular, it might be better not to
install the program directly to the USB drive. Just copy the cb2Bib base
directory from a home/own computer to the removable drive, and then run
it on the host computer as `cb2bib âconf`.

#### []{#relnotes083} Release Note cb2Bib 0.8.3

cb2Bib accepts several arguments on its command line to access specific
functionality. So far, the command `cb2bib tmp_ref` permits importing
references from the browser, whenever a *download to reference manager*
choice is available. In addition, the command `cb2bib âbibedit ref.bib`
directly launches the BibTeX editor for file browsing and editing.

This release adds the command line option `âconf [full_path]cb2bib.conf`
to specifically set a file where all internal settings are being
retrieved and stored. This has two interesting applications. On one
hand, it easily permits switching from several sets of extraction rules,
since the files `abbreviations.txt`, `regexps.txt`, and `netqinf.txt`
are all stored in the cb2Bib's settings. And, on the other hand, it
allows installing the program on a USB flash drive, and cleanly running
it on any (e. g., library) computer. Settings can be stored and kept on
the external device, and therefore, no data will be written on the
registry or settings directory of the host computer.

So far, however, this feature should be regarded as experimental. The Qt
library to which cb2Bib is linked does read/write access to system
settings in a few places (concretely, in file and color dialogs). On
Unix and Mac OS systems this access can be modified by setting the
environment variable DAG\_CONFIG\_HOME. No such workaround is presently
available in Windows.

See [cb2Bib Command Line](#commandline) for a detailed syntax
description.

#### []{#relnotes081} Release Note cb2Bib 0.8.1

Several changes in this release affect installation and deployment.
First, the cb2Bib internals for settings management has been
reorganized. Version 0.8.1 will not read previous settings, as user
colors, file locations, etc. On Unix, settings are stored at
`~/.config/MOLspaces/cb2Bib.conf`. This file can be removed, or renamed.
On Windows, it is recommended to uninstall previous versions before
upgrading.

Second, cb2Bib tags are not shown by default. Instead, it is shown
plain, raw clipboard data, as it is easier to identify with the original
source. To write a regular expression, right click, on the menu, check
'View Tagged Clipboard Data', and perform the extraction from this view.

And finally, cb2Bib adds the tag &lt;&lt;excerpt&gt;&gt; for network
queries. It takes a simplified version of the clipboard contents and
sends it to, e.g. Google Scholar. From there, one can easily import
BibTeX references related to that contents. Therefore one should
unchecked in most cases the 'Perform Network Queries after automatic
reference extractions' box.

#### []{#relnotes072} Release Note cb2Bib 0.7.2

cb2Bib reads the clipboard contents, processes it, and places it to the
main cb2Bib's panel. If clipboard contents can be recognized as a
reference, it writes the corresponding BibTeX entry. If not, the user
can interact from the cb2Bib panel and complete or correct the
reference. Additionally, this process permits to write down a regular
expression matching the reference's pattern.

To ease pattern writing, cb2Bib preprocesses the raw input data. This
can consider format conversion by external tools and general
substitutions, in addition to including some special tags. The resulting
preprocessed data is usually less readable. A particularly illustrating
case is when input data comes from a PDF article.

cb2Bib now optionally presents input data, as raw, unprocessed data.
This preserves the block text format of the source, and thus identifying
the relevant bibliographic fields by visual inspection is more
straightforward. In this raw mode view panel, interaction works in a
similar manner. Except that, no conversions or substitutions are seen
there, and that no regular expression tags are written.

#### []{#relnotes070} Release Note cb2Bib 0.7.0

This release moves forward cb2Bib base requirement to Qt 4.2.0.
Compilation errors related to rehighlight() library calls, kindly
reported by Bongard, Seemann, and Luisser, should not appear anymore.
File/URL opening is carried now by this library, in a desktop integrated
manner. Additionally, Gnome users will enjoy better integration, as
Cleanlooks widget style is available.

All known regressions in 0.6.9x series have been fixed. Also, a few
minor improvements have been included. In particular, file selection
dialogs display navigation history, and BibTeX output file can be
conveniently selected from the list of '\*.bib' files at the current
directory. Such a feature will be specially useful to users that sort
references in thematic files located at a given directory.

#### []{#relnotes0691} Release Note cb2Bib 0.6.91

This release fixes a regression in the cb2Bib network capabilities.
Network, and hence querying was erratic, both for the internal HTTP
routines and for external clients. In addition to this fix, the
`netqinf.txt` has been updated. PubMed is working again. Queries are
also extended to include DOI's. A possible applicability will be for
indexing a set of PDF articles with PDFImport. If the article contains
its DOI number, and 'Perform Network Queries after automatic reference
extractions' is checked, chances are that automatic extractions will
work smooth.

#### []{#relnotes0690} Release Note cb2Bib 0.6.90

cb2Bib has been ported from Qt3 to Qt4, a migration in its underlying
system library. Qt experienced many changes and improvements in this
major release upgrade. Relevant to cb2Bib, these changes will provide a
better file management, word completion, faster searches, and better
desktop integration.

Upgrading to Qt4 it is not a "plug and recompile" game. Thorough
refactoring and rewriting was required. The resulting cb2Bib code is
cleaner and more suitable to further development. As one might expect,
major upgrades introduce new bugs that must be fixed. The cb2Bib 0.6.90
is actually a preview version. It has approximately the same
functionality than its predecessor. So, no additions were considered at
this point. Its use, bug reporting, and feedback are encouraged. This
will help to get sooner a stable cb2Bib 0.7.

To compile it, type `./configure` as usual. The `configure` script calls
the `qmake` tool to generate an appropriate `Makefile`. To make sure the
right, Qt4 `qmake` is invocated, you can setup `QTDIR` environment
variable prior to `./configure`. The `configure`'s call statement will
then be `'$QTDIR/bin/qmake'`. E. g., type `'setenv QTDIR /usr'` if
`qmake` happens to be at the directory`/usr/bin`.

#### []{#relnotes060} Release Note cb2Bib 0.6.0

cb2Bib uses the internal tags `<<NewLine_n>>` and `<<Tab_n>>` to ease
the creation of regular expressions for reference extraction. New line
and tabular codes from the input stream are substituted by these
numbered tags. Numbering new lines and tabulars gives an extra safety
when writing down a regular expression. E. g., suppose field title is
'anything' between '`<<NewLine1>>` and `<<NewLine2>>`'. We can then
easily write 'anything' as '.+' without the risk of overextending the
caption to several '\\n' codes. On the other hand, one still can use
`<<NewLine\d>>` if not interested in a specific numbering. All these
internal tags are later removed, once cb2Bib postprocesses the entry
fields.

The cb2Bib identified so far new lines by checking for '\\n' codes. I
was unaware that this was a platform dependent, as well as a not
completely accurate way of detecting new lines. McKay Euan reported that
`<<NewLine_n>>` tags were not appearing as expected in the MacOSX
version. I later learn that MacOSX uses '\\r' codes, and that Windows
uses '\\r\\n', instead of '\\n' for new line encoding.

This release addresses this issue. It is supposed now that the cb2Bib
regular expressions will be more transferable among the different
platforms. Extraction from plain text sources is expected to be
completely platform independent. Extraction from web pages will still
remain browser dependent. In fact, each browser adds its peculiar
interpretation of a given HTML source. For example, in Wiley webpages we
see the sectioning header 'Abstract' in its source and in several
browsers, but we see, and get, 'ABSTRACT' if using Konqueror.

What we pay for this more uniform approach is, however, a **break in
compatibility** with previous versions of cb2Bib. Unix/Linux users
should not expect many differences, though. Only one from the nine
regular expressions in the examples needed to be modified, and the two
contributed regular expressions work perfectly without any change.
Windows users will not see a duplication of `<<NewLine_n>>` tags. To
update previous expressions it should be enough just shifting the
`<<NewLine_n>>` numbering. And, of course, any working regular
expression that does not uses `<<NewLine_n>>` tags will still be working
in this new version.

Finally, just to mention that I do not have a MacOSX to test any of the
cb2Bib releases in this particular platform. I am therefore assuming
that these changes will fix the problem at hand. If otherwise, please,
let me know. Also, let me know if release 0.6.0 'break' your own
expressions. I consider this release a sort of experimental or beta
version, and the previous version 0.5.3, will still be available during
this testing period.

#### []{#relnotes050} Release Note cb2Bib 0.5.0

Two issues had appeared regarding cb2Bib installation and deployment on
MacOSX platforms.

First, if you encounter a 'nothing to install'-error during installation
on MacOSX 10.4.x using the cb2Bib binary installer available at
naranja.umh.es/\~atg/, please delete the cb2bib-receipts from
`/Library/Receipts` and then rerun the installer. See also M. Bongard's
clarifying note 'MACOSX 10.4.X "NOTHING TO INSTALL"-ERROR' for details.

Second, and also extensible to other cb2Bib platform versions, if
PDFImport issues the error message 'Failed to call
*some\_format\_to\_text*' tool, make sure such a tool is installed and
available. Go to Configure-&gt;PDFImport, click at the 'Select External
Convert Tool' button, and navigate to set its full path. Since version
0.5.0 the default full path for the MacOSX is already set, and pointing
to `/usr/local/bin/pdftotext`.

#### []{#relnotes041} Release Note cb2Bib 0.4.1

Qt/KDE applications emit notifications whenever they change the
clipboard contents. cb2Bib uses these notifications to automatically
start its 'clipboard to BibTeX' processing. Other applications, however,
does not notify about them. Since version 0.2.1, see [Release Note
cb2Bib 0.2.1](#relnotes021), cb2Bib started checking the clipboard
periodically. This checking was later disabled as a default, needing a
few lines of code to be uncomented to activate it. Without such a
checking, cb2Bib appears unresponsive when selecting/copying from e.g.,
acroread or Mozilla. This release includes the class `clipboardpoll`
written by L. Lunak for the KDE's Klipper. Checking is performed in a
very optimized way. This checking is enabled by default. If you
experience problems with this feature, or if the required X11 headers
aren't available, consider disabling it by typing
`./configure âdisable-cbpoll` prior to compilation. This will disable
checking completely. If the naive, old checking is preferred, uncomment
the four usual lines, `./configure âdisable-cbpoll`, and compile.

#### []{#relnotes035} Release Note cb2Bib 0.3.5

Releases 0.3.3 and 0.3.4 brought querying functionality to cb2Bib. In
essence, cb2Bib was rearranged to accommodate copying and opening of
network files. Queries were then implemented as user customizable HTML
posts to journal databases. In addition, these arrangements permitted
defining convenience, dynamic bookmarks that were placed at the cb2Bib's
'About' panel.

cb2Bib contains three viewing panels: 'About', 'Clipboard' and 'View
BibTeX', being the 'Clipboard' panel the main working area. To keep
cb2Bib simple, only two buttons, 'About' and 'View BibTeX', are set to
navigate through the panels. The 'About' and 'View BibTeX' buttons are
toggle buttons for momentarily displaying their corresponding panels.
Guidance was so far provided by enabling/disabling the buttons.

After the bookmark introduction, the 'About' panel has greatly increased
its usefullness. Button functionality has been slightly redesigned now
to avoid as many keystrokes and mouse clicks as possible. The buttons
remain switchable, but they no longer disable the other buttons. User is
guided by icon changes instead. Hopefully these changes will not be
confusing or counterintuitive.

Bookmarks and querying functionality are customizable through the
`netqinf.txt` file, which is editable by pressing the `Alt+B` keys.
Supported queries are of the form 'Journal-Volume-First Page'. cb2Bib
parses `netqinf.txt` each time a query is performed. It looks for
`journal=Full_Name|[code]` to obtain the required information for a
specific journal. Empty, '`journal=`' entries have a meaning of 'any
journal'. New in this release, cb2Bib will test all possible queries for
a given journal instead of giving up at the first `No article found`
message. The query process stops at the first successfull hit or,
otherwise, once `netqinf.txt` is parsed completely (in an equivalent way
as the automatic pattern recognition works). This permits querying
multiple -and incomplete- journal databases.

Users should order the `netqinf.txt` file in a way it is more
convenient. E.g., put PubMed in front of JACS if desired an automatic
extraction. Or JACS in front of PubMed and extract from the journal web
page, if author accented characters are wanted.

So far, this querying functionality is still tagged as *experimental*.
Either the querying itself or its syntax seem quite successful. However,
downloading of PDF files, on windows OS + T1 network, **was found to
freeze** once progress reaches the 30-50%. Any feedback on this issue
will be greatly appreciated. Also, information on `kfmclient` equivalent
tools for non KDE desktops would be worth to be included in the cb2Bib
documentation.

#### []{#relnotes030} Release Note cb2Bib 0.3.0

cb2Bib considers the whole set of authors as an author-string pattern.
This string is later postprocessed, without requirements on the actual
number of authors it may contain, or on how the names are written. Once
considered author-string patterns, the extraction of bibliographic
references by means of regular expressions becomes relatively simple.

There are situations, however, where several author-strings are
required. The following box shows one of these cases. Authors are
grouped according to their affiliations. Selecting from 'F. N. First' to
'F. N. Fifth' would include 'First Affiliation' within the author
string. Cleaning up whatever wording 'First Affiliation' may contain is
a rather ill-posed problem. Instead, cb2Bib includes an `Add Authors`
option. The way of operation is then to select 'F. N. First, F. N.
Second, F. N. Third' and chose `Authors` and right after, select 'F. N.
Fourth and F. N. Fifth' and chose `Add Authors`.

``` {.fragment}
                                             Journal Name, 10, 1100-1105, 2004

                      AN EXAMPLE WITH MULTIPLE AUTHOR SETS

                     F. N. First, F. N. Second, F. N. Third
                                First Affiliation

                           F. N. Fourth and F. N. Fifth
                                Second Affiliation

  Abstract: Select from "Journal Name ..." to "... second author set.". The 'F.
  N. First, F. N. Second, F. N. Third' author string is automatically processed
  as one author set, while 'F. N. Fourth and F. N. Fifth' is processed as
  another, second author set.
```

At this point in the manual extraction, the user was faced with a red
`<<moreauthors>>` tag in the cb2Bib clipboard panel. The
`<<moreauthors>>` tag was intended to warn the user about the fact that
cb2Bib would not be able to consider the resulting extraction pattern as
a valid, general regular expression. Usual regular expressions are built
up from an a priori known level of nesting. In these cases, however, the
level of nesting is variable. It depends on the number of different
affiliations occurring in a particular reference.

So far the `<<moreauthors>>` tag has become a true FAQ about cb2Bib and
a source of many confusions. There is no real need, however, for such an
user warning. The `<<moreauthors>>` has therefore been removed and
cb2Bib has taken an step further, to its 0.3.0 version.

The cb2Bib 0.3.0 manual extraction works as usual. By clicking `Authors`
the Authors edit line is reseted and selection contents moved there.
Alternatively, if `Add Authors` is clicked, selection contents is added
to the author field. On this version, however, both operations are
tagged as `<<author>>` (singular form, as it is the BibTeX keyword for
Authors). The generated extraction pattern can now contain any number of
`<<author>>` fields.

In automatic mode, cb2Bib now adds all `author` captions to Authors. In
this way, cb2Bib can treat interlaced author-affiliation cases.
Obviously, users needing such extractions will have to write particular
regular expressions for cases with one set of authors, for two sets, and
so on. Eventhough it is not rare a work having a hundred of authors, it
would be quite umprobable that they were working on so many different
institutions. Therefore, few regular expressions should actually be
required in practice. Although not elegant, this breaks what was a
cb2Bib limitation and broadens its use when extracting from PDF sources.
Remember here to sort these regular expressions in decreasing order,
since at present, cb2Bib stops at the first hit. Also, consider
`Any Pattern` to get ride of the actual affiliation contents, as you
might not want to extract authors addresses.

#### []{#relnotes027} Release Note cb2Bib 0.2.7

The cb2Bib 0.2.7 release introduces multiple retrieving from PDF files.
PDF documents are becoming more and more widely used, not only to
transfer and printing articles, but also are substituting the personal
paper files and classifiers for the electronic equivalents.

cb2Bib is intended to help updating personal databases of papers. It is
a tool focused on what is left behind in database retrieving. Cases such
as email alerts, or inter colleague references and PDF sharing are
example situations. Though in an electronic format, sources are not
standardized or not globally used as to permit using habitual import
filters in reference managers. cb2Bib is designed to consider a direct
user intervention, either by creating its own useful filters or by a
simple copy-paste assistance when handtyping.

Hopefully someday cb2Bib will be able to take that old directory, with
perhaps a few hundreds of papers, to automatically index the references
and rename the files by author, in a consistent manner. The required
mechanism is already there, in this version. But I guess that this new
feature will manifest some present limitations in cb2Bib. For instance,
most printed and PDF papers interlace author names and affiliations.
cb2Bib doesn't have the means to automatically discern an author name
from a department or street name. So far one needs to manually use the
'Add to Authors' feature to deal with these situations. Also, the
managing of regular expressions needs developing, specially thinking in
the spread variety of design patterns in publications.

In summary, this current version is already useful in classifying and
extracting the reference of that couple of papers that someone send
right before submitting a work. A complete unsupervised extraction is
still far away, however.

#### []{#relnotes021} Release Note cb2Bib 0.2.1

The cb2Bib mechanism 'select-and-catch' failed in some cases. Acrobat
and Mozilla selections were not always notified to cb2Bib. Indeed, this
'window manager - application' connection seems to be broken on a KDE
3.3.0 Qt 3.3.3 system.

The cb2Bib 0.2.1 continues to listen to system clipboard change
notifications, whenever they are received and whenever cb2Bib is on
connected mode. Additionally, the cb2Bib 0.2.1 periodically checks for
changes in the system clipboard. Checks are performed every second,
approximately. This permits cb2Bib to work as usual, although one could
experience 1-2 seconds delays in systems where the automatic
notification is broken.

If the 'select-and-catch' functionality appears 'sticky', possibly
happening while using non KDE applications from where text is selected,
check the source file `c2bclipboard``.cpp`, look for `'Setting timer'`,
and set variable `interval` to 1000. This is the interval of time in ms
that cb2Bib will use to check for clipboard changes.
